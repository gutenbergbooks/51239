<p class="pn"><span class="beg">The</span> renown of the Scottish Metropolis,&mdash;that
city of wonders and of wisdom, of palaces and of
philosophy, of learned men and of lovely women,
had sounded so long and so loudly in their ears,
that toward the close of summer 1822, the Author
of these pages and the Sovereign of these realms,
were induced to pay it a visit, each in that state and
with that pomp and circumstance which was becoming
his station in the world. The one, in that unmarked
guise which is fitting for one who lives
more for the glory of others than of himself, and
who sets more value upon the single sentence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
preserves his memory when he is no more, than
upon all that he can possess or enjoy in this world.
The other, in that glow and grandeur, which gains
in intensity what it stands some chance of losing in
duration,&mdash;which is the grand idol of its day;
and which, when that day has closed, is gathered to
the sepulchre of its fathers, to make room for
another&mdash;and the same.</p>

<p>The Author of these pages must not be blamed,
or deemed disloyal, for having given his own name
the precedence of that of his Sovereign. Every
man in reality prefers himself before all the sovereigns
in the world; and wherefore should not one
man state this preference in words? The courtier
declares that all his services are devoted to his
king,&mdash;but he devotes them no longer than that
king can afford to pay for them: the soldier swears
that he will die in defence of the crown,&mdash;but he
never dies till he is compelled by the superior
strength or skill of another. Even upon general
grounds, therefore, there is candour if not courtesy
in this order of precedence.</p>

<p>But, when the specialities of the case are considered,&mdash;when
it is borne in mind that the monarch,
all-gracious and polite as he is, visited the
Athens, as well to dazzle the Athenians by his
grandeur, as to delight them by his bounty,&mdash;that
the native luminaries of that centre of many twinkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
lights were shorn of their beams by his overwhelming
radiance,&mdash;that this instance of kingly
condescension taught the ΔΕΜΟΣ of Athena to
regard as haply something less even than men,
those whom they had formerly looked upon as
possessing some of the attributes of divinity; and
when, on the other hand, it is taken into the account
that the author of these pages made his visit
solely with a view of seeing with his own eyes,
hearing with his own ears, and proclaiming with
his own lips, the truth of those reports which had
come to him through so many channels, and of
which the fruition had proved so much more delectable
than the foretaste: then, assuredly, ought
Athena herself, from all the castles of her strength,
the halls of her wisdom, the drawing-rooms of her
beauty, and the alleys of her retirement, to confess
that she owes to the author of these pages more
than kingly gratitude.&mdash;The King noticed but a
few of her people, enriched not many, and ennobled
almost none: those pages are intended to
enwrap the whole in one pure and perennial blaze of
glory.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the same day that
the Monarch took shipping at Greenwich amid the
shouts of assembled multitudes, and the Author
took his seat on the top of the Edinburgh mail,
amid piles of tailors’ boxes, each containing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
courtier’s habit, in which some fond, and fawning,
and fortune-desiring son of Caledonia was to bend
the supple knee in the presence of Majesty, within
the ancient palace of the Holyrood. The voyages of
kings, and the velocity of mail-coaches, are already
known and appreciated; and thus there needs no
more to be said, than that here also the Author
had by several days the precedence of the King.</p>

<p>The jolting of the wooden cases of my courtly
neighbours, together with forty-eight hours’ exposure
to drought by day and damp by night,
prepared me, in spite of all my burning anxiety to
see the far-famed city, for the enjoyment of several
hours of repose; and, as Athena was at this time
too much excited for permitting me to enjoy this
till towards morning, the sun had risen high before
I left my chamber.</p>

<p>Upon hurrying into the street,&mdash;into that Princes’
street, which, as I afterwards learned, is at certain
seasons of the year the favourite lounge of the
Athenian dandies, and at certain hours of the day
the favourite haunt of the Athenian fair, who
resort thither as the clock strikes four, to feast their
fair and anxious eyes upon the self-important forms
of dashing advocates, the more dapper and pursey
ones of pawkie writers to his Majesty’s signet, or
the attenuated striplings of the quill&mdash;the future
Clerks and Jefferys, who at that hour are returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from the harvest of law and profits to such feast
as awaits them in ample hall or elevated cock-loft,
according to their talents, their connexions, or their
purses;&mdash;upon hurrying into that street, in the expectation
of feasting my eyes upon the natural and
architectural glories of the city, I found that those
glories were in the mean time veiled in the maddening
preparations of a whole people, who had
come from every portion of the main land, and
from the remotest isle of Thulè, to wonder at and
to admire that mightiest marvel of human nature&mdash;a
king.</p>

<p>So novel and so varied were the costumes, so
unexpected and so singular were the features and
expressions, and so uncouth and Babylonish were
the voices, that the eye and the ear were confounded,
the judgment could not understand, and
the memory could preserve no record. Here you
might see some brawny and briefless barrister&mdash;the
younger son of a loyal family, with a pedigree at
least twice as long as its rental, with trowsers and
jacket <i>à la</i> Robin Hood, and huge blue bonnet
adorned with the St. Andrew’s cross and a turkey-cock’s
feather&mdash;looking for all the world like a
chimney-sweep’s Jack-o’-the-Green, or a calf
dressed entire and garnished with cabbage-leaves;
while close by him trotted a loyal toast-composing
crown-lawyer, with his hinder end cased in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
phillibeg, a feathered bonnet, at least a third of
his own height, an iron-hilted sword somewhat
more than the whole, and a dirk that might have
served for a plough-share, puffing and blowing
under the weight of his own importance, and the
accoutrements of the Celtic society. In close
juxtaposition with these was a genuine <i>Glhuine
dhu</i>, plaided, plumed, and whiskered, and looking
as if all the kings of the earth were nothing to
that swaggering chieftain, of whose <i>tail</i> he formed
no inconsiderable portion. In another place you
could catch the broad face and broader bonnet
of a lowland farmer of the old school, cased in one
uniform garb of home-made blue, with brass
buckles to his shoes, a brass key suspended to
his watch by a tough thong of black leather,
greasy enough,&mdash;holding solemn colloquy with that
reverend member of the Scottish Kirk, to whom
he acted in the capacity of ruling elder, about
the danger of compromising the interests of the
Whig or <i>high-flying</i> part of that establishment,
during the <i>avatar</i> of so many Tories. The reverend
gentleman himself was no bad sight. His
general-assembly coat and et cetera’s were duly
kept at home,&mdash;that is to say, in his two-shillings-a-week
apartments, up seven pair of stairs, in College-street,
or haply in the house of that town acquaintance
with whom he had found cheaper board,&mdash;till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the eventful days should arrive. Thus he
was habited in his parson’s grey, the breast of
which, where it projected beyond the perpendicular,
bore testimony to the fall, both of broth
and of punch, while his inferior regions were shaded
and shielded by dark-olive velveteens, a little tarnished,
worsted hose furrowed as neatly as the turnip-division
of his glebe, and cow-skin shoes of the
most damp-defying power, which borrowed no
part of their lustre from Mr. Robert Warren.
Still the good man was clean in his linen; his chin
was shorn like a new-mowed field; his visage
beamed forth gratitude for “a competent portion
of the good things of this life;” and his plump
and ruddy hands slumbered with much orthodox
ease in the capacious pockets of the velveteens.
Anon, a highland laird, whose <i>tail</i> comprised only
his lady and half a dozen of daughters, and who
seemed to be meditating upon the roofless castle
and ill-stored larder, to which the expense of
parading full thirty-six feet of female charms before
the King would subject him, during the weary
moons of the Highland winter, hurried past, not at
all at his ease.</p>

<p>But, to describe the individuals, strongly marked
as they were, would be altogether out of the question;
and, indeed, to give any thing like even a sketch of
the groups and classes and knots of men, women, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
children, in all habits, of all ages, and in almost
every variety of shape, would bankrupt even a
German vocabulary, although in that language one
be allowed, for clearness sake, to lump a score of
sentences into a single epithet. The cry was still
“they come,” and Caledonia, from fertile plain and
far mountain,&mdash;from toiling city and tiresome wilderness,&mdash;from
rock, and glen, and river,&mdash;upon
the wings of the wind, urged on by steam, drawn in
coach, chaise, waggon, cart, and hurdle, riding
upon horses, mules, and donkeys, and running
upon feet, shod and unshod,&mdash;came scudding and
smoking, and creaking and crashing, and reeking
and panting, in one conglomerating cloud, and one
commingling din, to distract the attention from the
attic glories of Edinburgh, and for a time drown
her classic sounds in the discordant and untunable
din of all the provinces. Here you had the broad
shoulders and bold bearing of the borderer, delving
an elbow, of the size and substance of a sirloin
of beef, into the skinny ribs of an Aberdonian
professor of humanity, who all the time kept
squeaking like a sick fiddle, in response to the bellow
of the other, which reminded you of a bull
confined in the vaulted hall of an old castle.
There grinned the fat face of an East Lothian farmer,
between a Perth baillie on the one hand, and
a Stonehaven scribe on the other, like a ram’s tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
between the blades of a shepherd’s sheers. And,
yonder gaped and wondered the great face of a
Glasgow negro-driver, like a Gorgon’s head&mdash;not
upon the shield of Minerva. Still there was something
interesting in the mighty and motley throng:
it put one in mind of Noah’s ark, which contained
“clean beasts, and beasts that are not clean, and
fowls, and every thing that creepeth upon the
earth.”</p>

<p>The most delectable part of the gathering was the
combined clans and the burgh corporations. The
former belted like warriors and bellied like weasels,
and tricked out for the occasion in their respective
tartans of their names, each bearing a sprig of the
symbolic tree in his bonnet, a huge claymore in the
one hand, and a relay of brogues and stockings
in the other, with a great horn snuff-mull thrust
into his <i>sporran</i>&mdash;open and ready for action&mdash;hurried
along at the <i>pas de charge</i> to their headquarters
for the time-being, where they were instantly
dispersed into the crowd, thence to reassemble
when the bagpipe should frighten the last
shadow of night.</p>

<p>The corporation-men came in less military but
more important guise. Glasgow, the queen of the
west, Aberdeen, the glory of the north, Dundee
and Perth, the rival empresses of the centre, with
Cupar-Fife, Crail, and a hundred others, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
charged with a loyal and dutiful address, which
had been composed by the town-clerk, revised in
the spelling by the schoolmaster, and was to be
discharged at the King, in a manner so powerful
and point-blank, as to procure knighthood if not
earldom for such candle-selling provost, breeches-manufacturing
baillie, or other chief magistrate
“after his kind,” came on with a splendour and
an importance that Scotland never before witnessed.</p>

<p>Glasgow, as became her purse and her pride,
came blazing like the western star&mdash;or rather like
a comet whose tail would have girdled half the
signs of the zodiac. The van was led by the magistrates,
in a coach which previously knew every
street and lane of the city, but which was relackered
for the occasion, had the city arms emblazoned upon
it as large as a pullicate handkerchief, and was
drawn by eight grey horses of the genuine Lanarkshire
breed,&mdash;the thunder of whose feet as they
dashed along shook the kirk of Shotts, and had
nearly laid Airdrie and Bathgate in ruins. The
clatter which they made along Princes’ Street was
astounding; the crowd collected in thousands at the
din; some cried it was the king himself; but the
final opinion was, that it was “naebody but the
magestrates o’ Glasgow.”</p>

<p>In the train of this goodly leading, there followed
full fifty thousand,&mdash;or to speak by measure, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
number was quite out of the question, full forty-four
miles of merchants and makers of muslin; and
the vehicles which carried the car-borne part of
them were more strange and varied than ever appeared
at the triumph of a Roman emperor upon
his return from smiting the barbarous nations, and
carrying themselves and all their utensils captive.
Here you would see the equipage of a rich dealer
in turmeric or tobacco, fashionable enough except
in its contents; there you were presented with a
Glasgow <i>Noddy</i>, squeezing forward its lank form
like a tile, and dragged by a steed with three serviceable
legs, and one eye the worse for the wear;
in another place you would meet with a hearse, with
a tarpaulin over it to hide the death’s head and the
bones, and crammed full of the saints of the Salt-market
laid lengthways for the convenience of stowage;
while the rear was brought up by an enormous
tilted waggon, which, though it was at first
conjectured to contain Polito’s collection of wild
beasts, was, upon examination, found to be charged
very abundantly with that more important and polished
matter&mdash;the ladies and gentlemen of Paisley
and Greenock.</p>

<p>The pride of the north had been more than
usually upon the <i>qui vive</i>. The Provost had been
attitudenizing before a great mirror for a week, and
getting his pronunciation translated into English by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Mr. Megget, of the Academy, for at least a fortnight;
the town-clerk had been drudging at “steps” in private
with Mr. Corbyn for a month, and the learned
Mr. Innes had been applied to, to cast the nativity
of the city; and, from the horoscope&mdash;Saturn in
conjunction with Mars, and Venus lady of the ascendant,
it was sagely inferred by the clubbed wisdoms
of King’s and Mareschal that the Provost “wad
get a gryte mickle purse o’ siller, for the gueed o’ the
ceety, forby a triffle to himsel’;” and that, if not
a duke, the town-clerk would be a <i>goose</i> at any
rate, if both eschewed during their sojourn that
hankering after the sex which was portended by the
lady Venus being in the middle house. Those
polite and philosophic preparations having been
made, the state coach, with two cats (the emblems
of <i>bon accord</i>) the size of a couple of yeanling
lambs, gilt with Dutch fulzie, and spotted with coffin
black, “all for the sparin’ o’ the cost,” rattled
along the bridge of Dee at the tail of six hardy
shelties from the Cabrach, “which could mak’ a
shift to live upo’ thristles, or fool strae, or ony thing
that they cou’d pyke up at a dykeside.” Still, however,
this mighty magisterial meteor streamed across
Drumthwackit, along the “how o’ the Mearns,”
and adoun Strathmore, like an aurora borealis flashing
from the pole to the zenith, flickering and crackling,
and smelling of brimstone. While its tail drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the third part of the wilie natives of the city;
the other two-thirds took their way in barks and
steam-boats, because it was “cheaper by the tae
half.”</p>

<p>But what words can describe the grand array of
the municipal authorities of Perth: Perth, the centre
and heart of Scotland&mdash;the capital of the Picts,
the delight of the Romans, who tumbled down in
ecstasy when they first beheld it from the summit
of Moncrief Hill, and, fancying that they saw in its
green <i>inches</i>, its sweeping river, and its ample size,
the Campagna, the Tiber, and the Eternal city,
shouted in one voice “Ecce Tiber! Ecce Campus
Martius!”&mdash;Perth, which looks upon Aberdeen as
dry stubble, and Glasgow as the dust of the earth;
and which has received within its halls and palaces
more kings and mighty men, than the compass of
these pages could hold, or the sages of its own Antiquarian
society could number.</p>

<p>To pay due honour to the decorum, the sagacity,
and the harmony of such a city, it is worth
while to pause and learn a little, before speaking
of the equipage. Well, what, gentle reader, shall
we learn? Why that the same gentleman who sat
in that splendid equipage as chief ruler of the city,
put to the proof, as touching his Celtic or Sarmatian
origin, no less a personage than the Grand Duke
Nicholas, brother to the autocrat of all the Russias&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
arbiter for the time being of all the legitimate
monarchs upon the continent of Europe. The fame
of the city of Perth being, of course, well known
upon the banks of the Neva, and the Kremlin at
Moscow having been burnt as the first portion of
the funeral pile of Buonaparte, there was no place
where the magnanimous Alexander could find a fit
pattern after which to build the restored Kremlin,
except this fine and far-famed city of Perth. The
Grand Duke Nicholas, from his well-known architectural
and other tastes, was deputed upon this important
mission; and, having taken London, the
Athens, and a few such places of inferior note in
his way, he arrived at the city of all beauty; and
was received by a bowing magistracy, and a gaping
populace. During his stay at the George Inn, the
superiority of the Tay salmon and “Athol brose,”
over the <i>caviere</i> and <i>quass</i> of his own country,
worked the imperial clay to the temperature of a
very Vesuvius. He applied to the Lord Provost in
his need. The Lord Provost convened his council.
Their words were wise, and their faces were wiser;
but they could determine nothing; and so they
handed the case over to the ministers and elders of
the kirk. These shut their eyes and opened their
mouths; and having done so for a due season, they
found that as the Grand Duke Nicholas was not
in communion with their church, the Grand Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Nicholas might, in all matters bodily or ghostly,
do as the said Grand Duke Nicholas felt inclined.
This response delighted the municipal authorities,
and they hurried to the inn to communicate with
their own lips this plenary indulgence. Provost
Robertson hemmed, stroked his beard, and led off
in words wherein the Saxon and the Celtic so perfectly
neutralized each other, that the whole was
as smooth as oil. But, though the Grand Duke
Nicholas understood many single languages, the
mouth even of a magistrate delivered of twins, was
as new to him as it was incomprehensible. It was
clear, from his lack-lustre eye, that he did not understand
one word of what was said; and he tried to
convey as much in Latin, French, German, Russ,
and no one knows how many other outlandish
tongues; but as the Grand Duke Nicholas could
not ascend to a double language, so neither could the
Provost of Perth descend to a single one; wherefore
the mighty mountaineer, who during the
Athenian display acted Perth, brushed up to him,
tumbling down half a dozen of splay-foot councillors
and ricketty deacons, and exclaiming, “Try her o’
the Gaelic, my Lord Provost! try her o’ the
Gaelic!”</p>

<p>A person of this calibre, and having buttoned
within his waistcoat the chief honour of a town of
this fame, could not choose but exhibit a corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
exterior. Accordingly, the coach was the
size of a fly van; the horses would have done credit
to Whitbread’s heaviest dray; and, in very deed,
had a sportsman of the land of Cockaigne seen the
emblazoned arms, pop would have gone Joseph
Manton right and left at the displayed eagle of
silver-white, as at a goose of kindred obesity, and
fit for the Michaelmas board.</p>

<p>Of those civic exhibiters, Dundee must close the
muster: Dundee, after these, was “filthy Dowlas.”
The wig of her chief magistrate, (which seemed
as though he had exchanged it with the Perth
coachman, as they had been taking a groats-worth
of swipes and thrippeny blue at Luckey Maccarracher’s
Hotel, down three flights of stairs, in
Shakspeare’s Square,) did not contain as much
sand-coloured hair as would have stuffed a pincushion;
and, as for the poll itself, not a barber in
Petticoat-lane would have shown it in his window.
Their equipage, which had once belonged to a
celebrated radical, was whitewashed for the occasion,
had two green salamanders marked upon it, as
lank as though they had fed upon smoke&mdash;as much
as to say that the lading within was proof against fire
and brimstone. Four experienced cattle, which
had been rescued or borrowed from the dogs’ meat-man,
dragged forward the heavy and heartless array;
and the brawling burghers took shipping at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
their new harbour; but Æolus was adverse, and
so they who had hoped to see George the Fourth
saw Holland, got fuddled with Scheidam gin,
bought a cargo of flax, and returned, not much
the wiser&mdash;that had been impossible.</p>

<p>This, and much more after the same fashion,
was enough and more than enough to distract the
attention from all the Athenses that ever were built
or blazoned in story. But this, and much more
like this, was not all: there was also much very
unlike it,&mdash;so unlike, that when you turned from
the one to the other, you felt as if seas had been
crossed; ay, as if the very poles of the earth had
been reversed, or as if you had passed from the
depth of folly to the height of wisdom in the twinkling
of an eye. There were the whole assembled
people of Scotland,&mdash;of that people who, girt with
no ill-suited authority, and tricked out with no
incongruous and tawdry pomp, had come in the
fullness of their hearts and the abundance of their
curiosity, to look upon their liege lord the King.
The magistrates in their coaches were senseless
pomp; the Highland chiefs with their tartans and
their tails, were a useless, and, in many instances
where they had commanded the small farmers to
leave their scanty crops to be scattered by the
winds or rotted by the rains, a cruel parade;
but the people,&mdash;the free and independent people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
who assembled of their own will, at their own
cost, and for their own pleasure, formed a solemnity
at which the eye could not fail to be
delighted, and over which the heart could not fail
to exult with the most ample and the most exquisite
joy. To the hundred thousand inhabitants of
Athens, there were added full twice as many strangers,
all in their best array; and yet, among the
whole there was nothing taking place at which
either law or delicacy could be offended. Religious
and political animosity had been laid aside, oppression
had been forgiven, and meanness forgotten;
the people seemed to compose but one family, and
they spoke as if animated with only one wish,&mdash;namely,
that the King should come: or if they had
another, it was that his coming might be speedy and
safe. Whatever other men may think of Edinburgh&mdash;of
Scotland, as a place to be visited, it is a
glorious place for being visited by a king; and, it
will be no proof of wisdom in the future monarchs
of Britain, if they allow the crown to pass to a
successor without paying it a visit. Kings reign
the more happily and the more secure, the more
freely and frequently that they show themselves to
their subjects.</p>

<hr class="d6" />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> movements of a people of so much gusto,
and grace, and gravity, as those who had interposed
their thickening clouds between my vision and
those municipal and mental glories which I had
come to see, could not choose but do every thing
according to the most approved canons of philosophy;
and thus the mighty matter of the royal
visitation had to be received in its beginning, its
middle, and its end, before I could proceed in my
legitimate and laudatory vocation. Besides the
people who came, there were the preparations made
and the deeds done,&mdash;each of which is well worthy
of a chapter.</p>

<p>The rumour of the high honour came upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Athens like the light of the morning,&mdash;beaming
upon the most elevated points, while yet the general
mass remained in shadow. The Lord President
of the Court of Session, the Lord Provost of the
City of Edinburgh, the Lord Advocate, Lady
Macconochie, the very Reverend, and (by office
and intuition,) very learned Principal Baird, the
Sheriff of the County, Deacon Knox, of Radical-threshing
renown, Mr. Archibald Campbell,
and that fair dame who watches and wipes in Queen
Mary’s apartments at the Holyrood, were the first
upon whom the radiance broke; and, the summit
of Ben Nevis gilded by the morning sun, looks not
more proudly down upon the mists of Lochiel or
the melancholy waste of Rannoch, than each and
all of those high personages did upon the ungifted
sons and daughters of Edinburgh. They
were in a fidget of the first magnitude, as to what
was to be done, and who was to do it. Long and
deep were their deliberations; but, like the Areopagites
of the Elder Athens, themselves and their
deliberations were in the dark. Hence, as hope
is the grand resource in such cases, they deputed
the Lord President to seek aid from the Royal
Society of Edinburgh,&mdash;a society which, composed
of the wisest heads, and prosecuting the wisest subjects,
always says and does the very wisest things
in the very wisest manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately the Society was sitting,&mdash;doing its
incubation, upon a refutation of Aristotle’s poetics
by Sir George M’Kenzie, of Coul, Bart., and a
proposal for lighting all the roads in Scotland with
putrid fish-heads, by Sir John Sinclair. The
Lord President opened his mouth and his case;
and each learned head nodded with the solemnity
of that of a Jupiter. The trumpet-call, blown
through the nose by a bandana handkerchief, summoned
to the charge the commodity of brains that
each possessed; and each having returned the bandana
to its place, looked as wise as the goddess of
the Elder Athens, or even as her sacred bird.
The general question propounded to them ran
thus,&mdash;“What was to be done, and by whom?” and
the deliverance of their wisdoms was, that “Every
thing ought to be done, and every body ought to
do it”&mdash;a response surpassing in profoundity any
thing ever uttered by the Pythoness herself. The
countenance of the dignified delegate was brought
parallel to the ceiling; his eyes and mouth had a
contest as to which could become the wider; and,
he Macadamized the question by breaking it into
smaller pieces: “What should they say to the
King; what should they give him to eat; and how
should they demean themselves?” It was resolved,
as touching the first, that they should say very
little, for fear of errors in propriety or in grammar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
but that they should put in motion the addressing-machinery,
of which official men in Scotland had so
often felt the benefit, and give, in “change for a
Sovereign” as it were, two hundred and forty of
those copper coins, for their own benefit, and that
of the royal closet. The second point was more
puzzling: A king would not care for sheep’s-head
or haggis, and as for French cookery, that would
be no rarity. Some lamented that the Airthrie
whale was petrified, and that Dr. Barclay’s elephant
was nothing but bones; and Sir John Sinclair
recommended three mermaids dressed entire,&mdash;of
which he assured them there were plenty on the
coast of Caithness. Upon this point there was a
difference of opinion; and they resolved to board
the King upon the enemy, by getting ten fat bucks
from that notorious Whig the Honourable W.
Maule, as his Grace of Montrose had only one to
spare. Upon the third point their decision was
equally summary and clear, “Every one was to do
the best that he could.”</p>

<p>Those sage counsels having been given and
received, the loyalty of Athens was set fire to in a
number of places, and anon the whole city was in a
blaze. Lords of session, spies, men who had eaten
flesh and drank wine for the glory of the throne,
excisemen, crown-lawyers, holders and expectants
of crown-patronages, address-grinders, beaconeers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and all the interminable file of that which had supported
the loyalty and existence of Scotland in the
worst of times, shone forth with first and fiercest
lustre. In that great tattle-market (hereafter to be
described,) the Parliament-house, you would have
found the Tory barristers&mdash;the current of whose
loyalty is seldom much broken by briefs, clubbing
together, cackling as though they had been the
sole geese of salvation to the capitol, and stretching
their mandibles, and showing their feathers at the
more-employed and laborious Whigs, as a race
soon to be exterminated. The disposal of majesty
himself was committed to the Great Unknown,
who sagely counselled that they should make a still
greater unknown of the King, by mewing him up
in Dalkeith-house, where he could commune only
with a few of the chosen; and, that they should
bring him before the public only once or twice, to
be worshipped and wondered at, more as a favour
of <i>their</i> procuring, than of his own Royal pleasure.
How little they knew of his Majesty, and how
much they had overrated their own importance
occurred not to them at the time, but they found it
out afterwards.</p>

<p>The next weighty question was what the city
should do in her municipal capacity; and, it was
ordered <i>in limine</i> that the nightly tattoo of “The
Flowers of Edinburgh,” which from time immemorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
had been played in the streets, should be
suspended during the solemnity, under pain of
escheat of the instruments, allenarly for the private
benefit and use of the Lord Provost and magistrates.
Every one who has seen Edinburgh must
know the perfect resemblance which her High-street&mdash;that
street in which magistracy is pre-eminently
dominant, and where shows are wont to be exhibited&mdash;bears
to the back-bone of a red-herring.
Westward you have the castle in form, in elevation,
and in grandeur, the very type of the head; eastward,
at the further extremity, you have the palace
of Holyrood, which from its lowly situation among
cesspools and bankrupts, and its usual gloomy and
forlorn condition, may very properly be likened to
the tail; the intermediate street is the spine; while
the wynds and closes which stretch to the North
Loch on the one side, and the Cow-gate on the
other, are the perfect counterpart of the ribs. This
High-street was cleared of some old incumbrances,
had exhibition-booths erected along its whole
extent; and it was expressly ordered that, as the
King passed along, no frippery or foul linen should
be exhibited from even the third garret windows;
and, that during the whole sojourn of royalty,
no man should enter the rendezvouses in the closes
by the street end, but come in by the back stairs;
<i>more clerici</i>, in the same fashion as during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sittings of the General Assembly. But, it would
be endless to notice all the sagacious orders and
prompt actings: suffice it to say, that every thing
which could be thought of was ordered, and every
thing ordered was done.</p>

<p>The people of the Athens are, even upon ordinary
occasions, much more attentive to their dress
than to their address; and, therefore, it was to be
expected that they should be so upon so momentous
an occasion. Besides the tailors’ boxes of which
I had felt a specimen on my journey, there was
work for every pair of sheers and needle in the
city. Webs of tartan, wigs, pieces of muslin,
paste diamonds, ostrich feathers, combs as well for
use as for ornament, were driving over the whole
place like snow-flakes at Christmas. But, the
hurry and harvest were by no means confined to
the Caledonian shop-keepers. The rumour had
reached the purlieus of Leicester-square, and had
been heard in the fashionable repositories of Holywell.
The remnant of Jacob gathered themselves
together, resolving to come in for their share of the
milk and honey which was flowing in the new-made
Canaan of Scotland; while the daughters of Judah
put tires upon their heads, and thronged away
to spoil the Amorites northward of the Tweed.
It were impossible to describe the wares brought by
the sons of Jacob,&mdash;it were needless to tell of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
brought by the daughters of Israel. The plume
which had nodded upon the brows of fifty queens
at Old Drury, was refurbished to adorn some
proud and pedigreed dame of the north; swords of
most harmless beauty&mdash;having nothing of steel
about them but the hilts, were crossed most bewitchingly
in every thoroughfare, accompanied by
old opera-hats, bag-wigs, buttons, and every thing
which could give the outward man the guise and
bearing of a courtier. Before these elegant repositories
slender clerks and sallow misses might be
seen ogling for the live-long day, and departing in
sorrow at nightfall, because the small tinkle in their
pockets was unable to procure for them even one
morning or evening’s use of that garb, the fee
simple of which had cost Moses seven shillings and
sixpence, and the translation and transmission a
crown-piece. Moses indeed found that he had
something else than Ludgate-hill and Regent-street
to contend with; for, every ribbon-vending son of
the North had garnished his windows with trinkets
and ornaments which, in appearance, in quality,
and in price, would have done honour to Solomon
himself.</p>

<p>But wherefore should I waste time on the ornaments
of individuals, when the garnishing of the
whole city was before my eyes,&mdash;when, from the
pier of Leith to the farthest extremity of Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
every act of the coming drama stood rubric
and impressed upon men and women, and things.
The first, important enough upon all occasions, had
now put on looks of ten-fold wisdom and sagacity.
The second, all bewitching as they are in their
native loveliness, were subjecting their necks to the
process of bleaching by chlorine gas, laying their
locks in lavender, sleeping in “cream and frontlets,”
and applying all manner of salves and unctions to
the lip, in order to make it plump and seemly for
the high honour of royal salutation. I have no
evidence that any daughter of the North fed upon
the flesh of vipers in order to induce fairness in her
own, as little have I evidence that there was need
for such a regimen; I did hear, however, that the
lady of one baronet took up her lodgings for two
successive nights in a warm cow’s-hide, and that
she of a senator of the college of justice wrought
wonders upon her bust by a cataplasm of rump-steak,
but I cannot vouch for the facts, or set my
<i>probatum</i> to them as successful experiments in
kaleiosophy. So much for the first blush of preparation
with the men and women; I need not add,
that like the streams of Edina, it became rich as
it ran.</p>

<p>The attitudes of things were a good deal more
diversified and puzzling; and, perhaps the shortest
way of getting rid of them would be to adopt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
laundress’ phrase, and say they were “got up;”
but this, though summary and in the main correct,
would neither be just nor satisfactory,&mdash;because, in
all modern stage displays, the actors would cut but
a sorry figure were it not for the scenery.</p>

<p>As, however, the scenery arises out of the drama
itself, while the actors have an existence and character
off the boards, it will be necessary to premise
an outline of the plot. That was arranged into
the following acts, with as many interludes public
and private as could be crammed into the time and
space. The King was to land&mdash;to be received by
whoever should be accounted the greatest and most
loyal man in Scotland, which some said was Lord
President Hope, some Bailie Blackwood, some Sir
Walter Scott, others Sir Alexander Gordon, of
Culvennan, a few Principal Baird, and even Professor
Leslie had his own vote and another&mdash;he was
to shake hands with Bailie Macfie, of Leith, (with
his glove on as it were,) then he was to pass along
streets, through triumphal arches, over bridges, and
in at gates, to the ancient palace of the Holyrood,
where the old throne from Buckingham-House had
been darned and done up for his reception, by way
of reading him an introductory lecture upon Scotch
economy. Such was to be the first act of the
drama, and the preparations for it were peculiarly
splendid. The line of progress, which was both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
long and broad, was to be thronged with people;
the devices and mottoes were to be got up, to let the
King know that an illumination was coming; the
ladies were instructed to fidget and wriggle in the
windows, by way of hint that there would be a
dance; the presence of Sir William Curtis made it
certain there would be turtle-soup; the curl of the
Reverend Dr. Lamond’s nose threatened a sermon;
the archery and men with white sticks pointed to a
procession; the hungry looks of the Burgh magistrates
and local men in authority, had obvious
reference to a levee; the pouting lips of the ladies
rendered a drawing-room indispensable; and the
bevies of breechless Highlanders and bandy-legged
Southerns in similar costume, were pretty sure
tokens of a theatrical exhibition,&mdash;and, from the
extreme officiousness of Glengarry, the Kouli
Khan of all the Celts, it was pretty apparent that
that exhibition could be nothing else than Rob
Roy&mdash;that prince of chieftains and cow-stealers.
Thus, while the first act was to be perfect in itself,
it was shrewdly contrived that it should develop
the sequence and economy of the others; but still,
to make assurance double-sure, the gazette writer
for Scotland, who had been a sinecurist since the
creation, was kept drudging at delineations of doings
and programmes of processions from morning
till night, and sometimes from night till morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>When the whole matter had been planned,&mdash;when
the officers of the household for Scotland had
got their robes of state,&mdash;when the archers had
learned to walk without treading down the heels of
each other’s shoes,&mdash;when the tailor, the barber,
and the dancing-master had done the needful upon
the Provost and Bailies,&mdash;when the tails of the
Highland chiefs had run quarantine,&mdash;when the
edge of the parsons’ appetites had been a little
blunted,&mdash;when the wonted tattoo had ceased,&mdash;when
lamps had been hung upon the front of every
house,&mdash;when the ladies had drilled themselves in
train-bearing, by the help of sheets and table-cloths,
and learned to do their salutations without any
inordinate smacking,&mdash;and when the elements of
dazzling and of din had been collected upon all the
heights, in the likeness of bone-fires, and bombs,
and bagpipes,&mdash;it wanted only the placing of the
royal foot upon the pier at Leith, to bring all those
mighty things into forward and fervent action.</p>

<p>Amid all those mighty preparations, there was
one thing which was very remarkable, and which
throws perhaps more light both upon the morale
of the spectacle and the feelings of the people, than
any other that could be mentioned. The Scots,
generally, are allowed to be a people of song and of
sentiment. There is a feeling in their melodies, an
alternate pathos and glee in their songs, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
enthusiasm and romance in their legends, which are
perhaps not equalled, and certainly not surpassed
by those of any nation in the world. This may
with truth be said of the nation, taking the average
of times and of places; and, when it is considered
that the Modern Athens holds herself up to the
world as a sort of concentrated tincture or spirit of
all that is fine or feeling in the country,&mdash;as being
the throne of learning&mdash;the chosen seat of sentiment
and of song; furthermore, when upon this occasion
there was gathered in and about the Athens, all the
lights which are acknowledged as shining, and all
the fires which are recognised as burning, in taste
and talent throughout Scotland; it must be acknowledged,
that something might have been expected
to go upon record worthy of such a people at such
a time. It had been known that the great Seneschal
of all those royal musters,&mdash;the ears of the
Lord Advocate, the mouth of the Lord President,
the eyes of the Lord Provost&mdash;to hear, to speak,
and to stare, at mighty things as it were;&mdash;it had
been known that, at the mere loosening of a bookseller’s
purse-strings, his verse had flowed rapid as
the Forth, and his prose spread wide as its estuary;
and surely it was not too much to hope that he would
consecrate in song, or conserve in story, an event
which was so congenial to his avowed sentiments,
and which must have been (from the fond and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
forward part he played in it) so gratifying to his
individual vanity. When, too, it was recollected
that this famed and favoured servant of the muse
had gone, invited or not invited, to London at the
Coronation, lest the Laureat should break down
under the compound pressure of solemnity and
sack, and the glory slide into oblivion for the want
of a fit recorder, it was surely to be hoped that he
would have done justice to the royal show in his
own country, and in his own city. But, <i>ecce ridiculus
mus!</i> the pen which had been so swift, and
the tongue which had been so glib at the bidding
of a mere plebeian bookseller, were still and mute
when a king was the god, and an assembled nation
the worshippers. He who had made the world to
ring again with the shouts of Highland freebooters,
and the din of whose tournaments yet sounds in our
ears, failed at the very point of need! “Ah, where
was Roderick then! One blast upon <i>his</i> bugle
horn” had been worth all the senseless vulgarity
from Princes’-street, and all the piddling inanity of
Tweedale-court. It was wished for, it was called
for, it was imperious upon every principle&mdash;not of
consistency merely, but of gratitude; but it came
not; and all that stands recorded as having
come from his otherwise fluent pen upon the occasion,
is a paltry and vulgar drinking song, which it
would disgrace the most wretched Athenian <i>caddie</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to troll in the lowest pot-house of the Blackfriars
wynd.</p>

<p>If one whose piping is so gratefully received
and so amply rewarded, and whose loyalty has been
withal so abundant and so profitable, remained
mute or degenerated into mere foolery upon the
occasion, what could be expected from the provincial
and unhired dabblers in verse, who write only to
the casual inspiration of love or liquor, and melt
in madrigals or madden in catches according as
Cupid or Bacchus holds the principal sway!
Nothing, I maintain, and therefore the Great Unknown
is guilty not only of his own omission, but
of that of all his countrymen. If he had done as he
ought,&mdash;done in a way worthy of himself&mdash;putting
the occasion entirely out of the question, there is
not a doubt but the whole drove would have been
at his heels. As the case stands, whatever may be
the comparative merits of the Whig <i>becks</i> and
Tory <i>booings</i>, the poetic eclat of the visit of George
the Fourth must succumb to that of the descent of
Jamie in sixteen hundred and eighteen.</p>

<p>How is this to be accounted for?&mdash;I can see
why the mouths of the minor poets must have
remained shut; but, to find an apology for the
master one, is no such easy matter; and perhaps the
safe way for all parties would be to place his salvation
in consternation by day, and cups by night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Still, it is remarkable that, though this was the
only royal visit with which Scotland had, during
the reigns of six monarchs, been honoured, there
is no where existing a single decent page, either in
verse or in prose, in commemoration of it; and, if
the long preparation which was made for it, the
bustle which it occasioned, and the crowds which
it drew together, be considered, one would feel
disposed thence to conclude, that the Athenians,
instead of being that literary people which they are
represented, are a set of ignorant barbarians. This
however is, as themselves say, not the fact, and
therefore there must be a cause for their supineness.
That cause, however, being beyond the
depth of my philosophy, must be left to their
own.</p>

<p>While the Athens was making all preparations
to receive the king, and the king all speed to visit
the Athens, the elements, those outlaws from even
royal authority, created a little anxiety on both
sides. The weather, which had been propitious at
the outset, became (notwithstanding that the mayor
of Scarbro’, in his zeal to present a loyal address
at the end of a long stick, had been chucked into
the sea, like another Jonah, and not swallowed
up by a whale) not a little unpleasant, as the
royal squadron approached that singular rock,
once the abode of state prisoners, and now of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Solon geese, denominated the Bass, and resembling
more than any thing else a great pigeon-pie
riding at anchor. The chosen had arranged
that this same rock, emblematical of the ancient
manners as a prison-house, and haply of the modern
men as a gooserie, should be the first Scottish
soil trodden by the royal foot. Some said, that
this was intended to show that, though the said
chosen were unable to contend with their political
opponents in argument, they had the power on
their side, and could send them to prison; but
that is a point without the scope of my speculation,
and it is of no consequence, as the Father of
the sea would not permit the Father of the British
people to land.</p>

<p>When a day and night more than had been calculated
upon were expired, without any tidings of
the royal squadron, the gloom of the Athenian
authorities became sad in the extreme. Here you
would find one wight twining up the steep acclivities
of Arthur’s Seat, jerking his fatigued corpus upon
the pile of coal which had been collected upon the
top for a bon-fire, and straining his owl-like eyes
to penetrate the dense fog of the eastern horizon,
like a conjuror ogling the volume of futurity; and
there would go a frowsy bailie or fat sheriff hotching
and blowing to the observatory on the Calton
Hill, keeping the anxious window of his wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
for ten minutes at the telescope, and leaving it with
a growl that he could “see nothing,”&mdash;and how
could he, bless his honest soul! for he had not removed
the brass cap from its opposite extremity?
No matter: bailies and sheriffs must understand
Erskine’s Institutes, but a telescope was quite another
thing. Amid this looking and lamenting, the
wind freshened, and it rained; and there were also
one or two distant growls of thunder, which fear
very naturally converted into signals of distress
from his Majesty’s yacht. Upon this, the mental
agony became immense; and, saving an attempt
on the part of Kerne of the Clan Donnochie, to
open with his dirk a free passage for the soul of a
Canon-gate constable, no event had broken the
gloom of that dismal Tuesday. “Mirk Monday”
had long been a day accursed in the Scottish calendar,
and it was now feared that his younger
brother was to reign in his stead.</p>

<p>Next morning was little better; and though all
the loyal spirits of Athens scrambled to the heights
to call the king from the fog-enshrouded and
“vasty deep,” there was no answer to their call,
save the hollow booming of the east wind, and the
melancholy scream of these sea-fowl which had
escaped from the storm. They who had been instrumental
in bringing their sovereign into such
peril, wist not what to do; and, as is the case with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
most men in such a situation, they did nothing,&mdash;at
least nothing which could increase his safety, or
accelerate his arrival.</p>

<p>Still the preparations went on; and, in the sadness
and anxiety of the day, the drilling of the
highlanders and archers&mdash;who had become so expert
as to face all possible ways at a single word of
command&mdash;were not a jot abated, while the gloom
of the night was broken by the clinking of hammers
erecting scaffolding in every thoroughfare, as
well as by pattering feet of official and other men
learning to “make their legs” against the levee,
and the scratching of grinders’ pens translating, redacting,
and otherways brushing up loyal and dutiful
addresses, which came before them on all
complexions of paper, and in all concatenations of
orthography. Nor were these glimpses through
the gloom confined to sounds; the sights were
equally delectable. Here, one might catch a sight
of some single star, not of the first magnitude,
twisting her face into all expressions, and her
neck into all attitudes, in order to find the barleycorn
of beauty in the bushel of chaff; and there
again might be beheld a whole constellation, bedraperied
with sheets as aforesaid, streaming forward
through some long gallery, tailed and terrible
as comets, and then retreating backwards
with perplexed and puzzled steps, tucking up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sheets as they progressed, and occasionally dropping
like falling stars from the firmament of their
practice.</p>

<p>Morning dawned; and the sleepless eyes and
speculationless telescopes again faired forth to scan
the gloomy east. One from the top of the Calton,
cried “There is the Royal George! I know her
by the spread of her sails, and the sweep of her oars.”
The crowd looked toward the sea, and saw nothing.
The observer looked at his telescope: a
moth had settled upon the object glass, with downy
wings elevated above, and feet and feelers extended
below. Still the crowd collected, till every height
commanding a view of the point at which the
Forth mingles its broad waters with the ocean,
was absolutely paved with human beings, all worshipping
towards the east, with more intense devotion
than a caravan of Moslem pilgrims in the
desert.</p>

<p>Toward mid-day, the more experienced eye, or
better-ordered glass of the port-admiral at Leith,
descried the smoke of the assisting steam-boats.
Up went the royal standard; every gun of every
ship in the roads told the tidings; and instantly
the echoes of cliff and castle rang to the shouts
of an hundred thousand joyous voices. All was
bustle and scramble. Heralds marshalling here,
clans mustering there, and people crowding everywhere;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
while the royal squadron, now aided by
a gentle but favourable breeze, stood majestically
toward the roads, where it anchored about two
o’clock. Anon the water was peopled with loyalty;
the splendour of dresses and of flags dazzled the
eye; and the swell of all sorts of noises deafened
the ear. The equilibrium of the clouds was unsettled;
and, just as preparations were making
for the landing, rain fell in torrents. Lest so
much finery should be spoiled in the first scene
of the drama, the grand ceremony was postponed
till the next morning. The king, in the mean
time, received at the hands of Sir Walter Scott,
a St. Andrew’s cross, the gift of some ladies of
Scotland, whose names (prudently perhaps) never
were distinctly published. Nearly at the same
time with this, came a messenger of another description.
He told that the Marquis of Londonderry
was no more; and thus, even the royal
joy was not wholly unmingled. Still the king
showed himself to his aquatic visitors in the
most courteous manner; and, perhaps, the two
events were the better borne that they came
together. Thus the Athens had another night
for preparation; and, as it was not a night of
fear, that preparation went on with increased
activity and spirit. She had now seen the king;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and but a night was to elapse, ere the gratification
was to be mutual, by the king seeing her. On
his part, indeed, it should have been greatest, as
she had given herself most trouble, and would
continue longest to feel the cost.</p>

<hr class="d6" />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Every</span> one, who having heard of the splendour
which is attendant upon royalty while dwelling
at a distance from the scene of its display, has
thence been induced to mingle himself with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
crowd of ordinary spectators, must have felt how
much the reality falls short of the anticipation.
One sees a gaudy vehicle drawn slowly along, and
within it a human being, apparently but ill at his
ease, and obviously feeling the same danger of
tumbling from his unnatural and elevated seat as
one perched upon the top of a pyramid. A crowd,
usually formed of the ill-dressed and the idle, run
and roar about the carriage; the trumpeters play
“God save the King,” the attendants wave their
hats and cheer, and the spectacle, having passed
through its routine, is no more heeded. In London,
for instance, those state processions which the etiquette
of the court inflicts upon the sovereign, are
not more imposing than a Lord-Mayor’s show;
and even the most loyal, unless it conduces in some
way or other to their personal interest, care little
for a second display.</p>

<p>With this experience, I had prepared myself
for being disappointed in that spectacle which had
brought Scotland together; and I <i>was</i> disappointed.
But my disappointment was of a new
kind; for the solemnity, the grandeur, and the
effect of the scene, were just as much superior to
what I had hoped for, as those of any analogous
scene that I had witnessed fell below the anticipation.
The Scots are, unquestionably, not a superstitious
people; neither do they care for parade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Upon ordinary occasions, too, they are a disputing
and quarrelling, rather than an united people; and
with the exception of those who are either paid or
expect to be paid for it, they are by no means inordinate
in their loyalty. But they are a people
whose feelings have the depth, as well as the placidity,
of still waters; the rocks, the rivers, and even
the houses, are things of long duration; there is no
portion of his country, upon which the foot of a
Scotchman can fall, that speaks not its tale or its
legend; and there is no Scotchman who does not
look upon himself as identified with the annals of his
country, and regard Edinburgh as the seat of a
royal line, of which no man can trace the beginning,
and of which no Scotchman can bear to contemplate
the end; and which, though it has been bereaved
of its royal tenant by an unfortunate union
with a more wealthy land, is yet more worthy of
him, and more his legitimate and native dwelling-place,
than any other city in existence.</p>

<p>The operation of those feelings, or prejudices, or
call them what you will, produced upon the occasion
of which I am speaking, a scene, or rather a
succession of scenes, of a more intense and powerful
interest than any which I had ever witnessed,
or, indeed, could have pictured to myself in the
warmest time and mood of my imagination. I had
thought the thronging of the people to Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a ridiculous waste of time; I had laughed till every
rib of me ached, at the fantastic fooleries of the
Celts and Archers, and the grotesque array of the
official men; and founding my expectations upon
these, I had made up my mind that the whole matter
was to be a farce or a failure. But I had taken
wrong data: I had formed my opinion of Scotland
from the same persons that, to the injury and the
disgrace of Scotland, form the channel through
which the British Government sees it; and therefore
I was not prepared for that solemn and soul-stirring
display,&mdash;that rush of the whole intellect of a reflective,
and of the whole heart of a feeling people,
adorned and kept in measured order, by that intermixture
of moral tact and of national pride, which
was exhibited to the delighted King, and the astonished
courtiers. It seemed as though hundreds
of years of the scroll of memory had been unrolled;
and that the people, carrying the civilization, the
taste, and the science, of the present day along
with them, had gone back to those years when
Scotland stood alone, independent in arms, and invincible
in spirit.</p>

<p>As, to the shame of the literature of Scotland,
and more especially to that of the Athens&mdash;who
arrogates to herself the capability of saying every
thing better than any body else, no account of this
singular burst of national feeling has appeared, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the gossiping newspaper-reports at the time,
and a tasteless <i>pot pourri</i>, hashed up of the worst
of these, with scraps of gazettes, and shreds of addresses,&mdash;in
which, more especially the latter, it
would be vain to look for any trace of the spirit of
the people,&mdash;it is but an act of common justice in
me to devote a few pages to it, though I know well
that I shall fail of the effect which I am anxious to
produce. In order, as much as I can, to guard
against this, I shall divide the remainder of this
chapter, (which, in spite of me, will be rather a
long one,) into as many sections as there were acts
in the drama of the King’s visit. The first of
these will of course be,</p>


<p class="pc1 reduct">THE PROCESSION TO HOLYROOD.</p>
<p class="pc reduct">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;“He comes, he comes!<br />
Sound the trumpets, beat the drums.”</p>

<p class="p1">It seemed as though the lowering skies and
sweeping storms, which had made the longing people
of Scotland almost despair of the pleasure of
the royal visit, and which had drenched them, and
given them a whole night of impatient delay, when
the King was not many furlongs from the Scottish
shore, had been intended to heighten by their contrast
the splendour and eclât of the royal debarkation.
The morning of Thursday, the 15th of
August, dawned in all the freshness of spring, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in all the serenity of summer. The rains had given
a renovated greenness to the fields, and a thorough
ablution to the city; and while the first rays of the
morning sun streamed through the curling smoke
of fires that were preparing the breakfast of three
hundred thousand loyal and delighted people, they
painted upon the adjoining country that “clear
shining after rain,” which is, perhaps, the fairest and
freshest guise in which any land can be viewed. The
soft west wind just gave to the expanded Firth as
much of a ripple as to shew that it was living water,
without curling the angry crest of a single billow.
There was a transparency in the air, of which those
who are accustomed only to the murky atmosphere
of London, or the exhalations of the fat pastures of
England, could have no conception. Not only the
colour of every pendant in the roads, but the cordage
of every ship, and the costume of every one on
board, was discernible from the elevated grounds
about Edinburgh; and, while standing on the
Calton Hill, the royal squadron, with thousands of
boats and barges sporting around it, on the one
hand,&mdash;and the bustling crowd on the other,
decked in their various and gaudy attire, flitting
past every opening, and filling every street that
was visible, composed a panorama of the most spirit-stirring
description.</p>

<p>The ancient standard of Scotland was hoisted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Holyrood; the ancient crown and sceptre of Scotland
were there ready to be lent to his Majesty,&mdash;but,
too sacred and too dear to Scotland as the symbols
of her old and loved independence, for being
given to a king, whom she had come from her
utmost bourne, decked herself in her finest apparel,
and tuned her heart to its choicest song of joy, to
welcome; the royal household of Scotland, more
showy in their attire, and more self-important in
their bearing, than is usual where kings are
subjects of daily exhibition, because the robes and
the occupation were new, were proceeding toward
the place of their rendezvous by the longest and
most circuitous paths that they could find out,
anxious to levy their modicum of admiration ere
the more transcendent splendour and dignity of
the king should draw all eyes towards itself, and
leave them as the forgotten tapers of the night,
after the glorious orb of day has climbed the east;
the Caledonian fair were thronging to the casements,
(balconies there were none,) each looking
more happy than another, and one could easily
perceive that faces, which, during a reasonable
lapse of years&mdash;either through the fault or the
failure of Hymen&mdash;had been stiffened by sorrow,
and saddened by despair, were that day to be
decked in their earliest, their virgin smile,&mdash;a smile
which, they were not without hopes, might draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
other eyes, and charm other hearts, than those of
their sovereign; and the maddening burghers and
wondering yeomen were trotting about from place
to place; and, in their zeal for obtaining the best
sight of the king, running some risk of not seeing
him at all.</p>

<p>Having seen the muster of the official men&mdash;as
well those who were to proceed to the pier of Leith
to receive his Majesty, as they who were to deliver
to him the keys of the city of Edinburgh, and
thereupon speak a speech, into which a full year’s
eloquence of the whole corporation, with some assistance
of the crown lawyers, and a note or two
by Sir Walter Scott, was crammed,&mdash;having examined
the facilities which the people along the
line of the procession had given the tenants of a day
for gratifying their eyes,&mdash;and having felt more joy
at heart than I had ever done at a public spectacle,
at seeing so vast a multitude so very happy,
and so very worthy of happiness,&mdash;I set about
choosing my own station, in order that I might
gaze, and wonder, and be delighted with the rest;
and, after very mature deliberation, I resolved
that that should be upon the leads of the palace
of Holyrood, provided I could get access to the
same.</p>

<p>Access was by no means difficult to be obtained,
nor was my ascent to the top of the ancient structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
without its pleasures. In the first place, I
passed through the apartments of the fair queen of
Scotland,&mdash;the fairest, and all things considered,
perhaps, the frailest of royal ladies; and there I
found the whole localities of Rizzio’s murder, well
preserved both in appearance and in tradition. In
the second place, I had the pleasure of seeing upon
the leads, dressed in the plain tartan of her adopted
clan, the fair Lady Glenorchy, who possesses all
the charms of Mary, without any of her faults.
I am not sure that I ever saw a finer woman; I am
sure that I never saw one in whose expression intellect
was more blended with sweetness, or spirit
softened and enriched by modesty and grace.</p>

<p>Besides those intellectual (is that the term?)
pleasures, there were other things which rendered
my locality the best of any: First, it commanded
a larger and better view of the procession; and,
secondly, though Edinburgh looks romantic from
my situation, there is none where it becomes so
perfect a fairy tale. While I paced along the
leads of the palace, and I had ample time to do it,
I was more and more rivetted, both in motion and
in gaze, by the wonderful scene. Eastward was
the expanse of blue water, widening and having no
boundary in the extreme horizon, and confined
every where else between the soft, green, lovely,
and productive shores of Lothian and Fife. Along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the whole visible portion of the waters, no ship
was going forth upon her voyage, but many were
cruizing towards the port of Leith by the combined
powers of every thing that enables man to
make his way upon the deep. Northward rose the
Calton Hill, ornamented with one of the best and
one of the worst specimens of modern architecture,
having a park of artillery and a picquet of horsemen
upon its summit, and its sides groaning under
the weight of a multitude which no man could
count. Sufficiently elevated at one place for throwing
its more elevated objects against the sky, and
rapid enough in its slope for bringing out at whole
length the masses of people who occupied it, the
Calton did not conceal either the royal squadron in
Leith roads, or the majestic summits of the remote
Grampians,&mdash;from which every cloud and every
trace of mist had been brushed away, when I
first ascended, while the strong and peculiar refraction
that the atmosphere in such cases exerts,
gave to them only half their distance and
double their height, as if the mountains themselves
had raised them from the beds of their primeval
residence, and come near, to behold the splendour
which the Athens had put on, and the glory with
which she hoped to be blessed. Towards the
south, Salisbury Craggs and Arthur’s Seat raised
their summits to the mid heaven, and threw their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
broad shadows over the valley, into which the
beams of light which poured in at the openings of
the majestic wall of rock, seamed the blue shadow
as the lapis lazuli is seamed by gold. The view
this way was to me peculiarly sublime, not only
from the great contrast that it formed with every
thing around, and indeed every thing that one
could conceive to exist in the vicinity of a city,
but because of its own peculiar and inherent sublimity,
and the wild accompaniments with which
it had been decorated for the occasion. The crags
rose rugged and perpendicular, with their profile
dark as night, while standards, and tents, and
batteries, and armed men on foot and on horseback,
hung over the wild and airy steep. A flood
of mellow light which came in from behind gave
them the lineaments of giants, and a glory of colouring
far exceeding any thing that limner ever
tinted. Then rose the more sublime height of
Arthur’s Seat, thrown back by the vapour which
the sun was exhaling from the dew in the dell between,
and having its summit haloed with a glory
of radiant prismatic colours, through which the
solitary stranger or flitting picquet seemed beings
of another world. And, as the sun-beams came
and went upon burnished helm or brazen cuirass,
the whole seemed spotted with gold, or inlaid with
costly stones. At my feet was the court of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
palace, in which the royal standard was guarded by
a fine body of highlanders, and the palace-gates kept
by a goodly array of the Edinburgh archery, who,
though they seemed not to be the least important
part of the spectacle in their own eyes, were yet
intent upon procuring for their favoured fair those
situations from which they would best view the
glories of the archers and of the king.</p>

<p>Before me, the Athens herself clustered her
buildings, and shot up her towers, her spires, and
her castles, with a witchery of effect, which can be
equalled by the view of no other British city, and
surpassed by that of the Athens from no other
point. When one, for instance, ascends the top of
St. Paul’s, one wonders at the business and bustle
that is around; but the eye is tired with the
interminable lines of dull brick, and the dingy
clusters of puny steeples, and smoking chimney-stalks;
while the sound, and the rushing, and the
artificial origin of the whole, make one melancholy
with the idea that it will not last. One should
never look down upon a city: the sight is always
dingy, and the view always produces melancholy.</p>

<p>From the leads whereon I stood, though I was
high above the court of the palace, I was below
all the city except that rubbish which was concealed;
and never did the mere sight of houses
produce such an effect upon me. The ground was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
so magical, and the buildings so different in form,
that the whole seemed as though it had been
moulded by the hands of giants, or commanded
into existence by the fiat of a god; and, in firmness
and colour, it was so like the rocks upon
which it rested, and by which it was surrounded,
that it looked as though it had lasted from the
beginning of time, and would endure to the end.
Right in front of me, the high street opened at
intervals its deep ravine; upon the summit of a
hill, but still, from the great height of the houses,
appearing as if that hill had been cleft in twain,
to open a way from the palace on which I stood
to the castle, which, from its aged rock at the
other extremity, looked proudly down as the monarch
of the Athens, seated upon a throne which
would out-exist those of all the monarchs of the
nations. Around this were clustered palace and
spire, each upon its terrace, while the spacious
bridges, beneath whose arches the distant Pentland
hills and the sky were visible, formed an aërial
path from the grandeur of one place to the grandeur
of another.</p>

<p>There was something so novel, so wildly romantic,
and so overpowering, in all this, that I
retired to the most remote and elevated part of
the roof, leaned me against a chimney-stalk, and,
forgetting the king, the procession, the people, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
myself, was in one of those reveries, in which the
senses are too much gratified, and the judgment
too much lost for allowing the fancy to sketch,
and the memory to notice. “This is incomprehensibly
fine!” were the words which I then ejaculated
to myself; and now that the presence of the
picture is gone, and the recollection such as no
mind could retain, I can do nothing more than
repeat them.</p>

<p>I stood thus absorbed till about mid-day, at
which time the flash and the report of a solitary
gun from the royal yacht caught my eye and my
ear, and made me start into recollection. Just
then, a cloud of the most impenetrable darkness
had collected behind, or, as it appeared to me,
around the castle, which made the Athens appear
as if her magnitude stretched on into the impenetrable
gloom of infinitude. But I had no time to
pursue the train of feeling to which that would
have given rise; for the volleyed cannon&mdash;flash
upon flash and peal upon peal, and the huzzaing
people&mdash;shout upon shout and cheer after cheer,
made the cliffs and mountains ring around me,
and the palace rock under my feet, as though the
heavens and the earth had been coming together,
and the Athens had been to be dashed to pieces in
the maddening of her own joy. The ships in the
roads first pealed out the tale, and the blue waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the Forth were enshrouded in a vesture of silvery
smoke. Anon the batteries upon the Calton
took up the tidings; and their roar, all powerful
as it was, was almost drowned in the voices of the
thousands which thronged that romantic hill. In
an instant, the same deafening sounds, and the
same gleaming fires, burst away from the Craggs on
the left; and the cannon and the cry continued to
call and to answer to each other from the right
hand and from the left, as&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">&mdash;&mdash;“Jura answers through her misty shroud,<br />
Back to the joyous Alps, which call to her aloud,”</p>

<p class="pn1">till every atom of the air was reverberating with
sound, every cliff and every building returning its
echo, the ground reeling to the noise, the fleecy
smoke hanging upon the cliffs like the clouds of
heaven, or settling down till the Athens put on
the appearance of a sea, in which the more elevated
buildings and spires seemed islets, and the
castle, with her glaring fires, and her astounding
volleys, towered like an Etna, burning, blazing,
and thundering across the deep. What with the
closing of the natural clouds, and the spreading of
the artificial ones, the darkness which even at noon-day
had settled over the city was awfully sublime;
even the mass of the castle, large and lofty though
it be, was shrouded in the thick vapour of the sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and of itself, so that all which the eye could discern,
was the flashes of artillery contending with
the flickering of distant lightning, and all that the
ear could hear was the mingled peal and jubilee,
in the pauses of which the voice of the distant
thunder was too feeble for being heard. The darkness
borrowed additional sublimity, if indeed that
was possible, from the pure and unclouded light of
the sun, which a few straggling beams that occasionally
stole their way as far as the slopes of
Arthur Seat, told me was sleeping upon the plains
of Lothian; and the din of the joy received all the
accession of contrast from the stilly silence which
reigned in the deserted halls and desolated villages
of that busy and blooming land. Amid this darkness
and din, the royal barge rowed softly towards
the Scottish strand, and the sovereign of these
realms was the first to set his foot upon Scottish
ground, while the author of these pages occupied
the very pinnacle of the Scottish palace. The
magistrates of Leith, all tingling and but ill at
their ease, stood shaking and speechless to receive
him; but their blushes were a good deal spared
by those grand monopolists of Caledonian loyalty,
the lords president, justice clerk, baron register,
and advocate, and that mighty master of the ceremonies,
and that mightier memorialist, (who, it
was hoped, would cut the thing into everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
brass,) Sir Walter Scott. But though the monopolizing
lords blushed not, they blanched a little,
when they found the eyes of the king turning everywhere
with the same beaming delight upon the
people, whose appearance and whose conduct
showed him that Scotland, if not the most polished,
was by no means the least polished jewel
of his crown; and the baronet, who haply was
brought there, chiefly from the eclât which his
literary renown would confer upon his less gifted
but more official associates, found perchance that
the glory of an author, however high in itself, and
however rewarded, is but a tiny instrument of
Royal joy.</p>

<p>The guardsmen, who very judiciously were chiefly
either Scottish citizens or Scottish soldiers, succeeded,
not in keeping order among their countrymen, but in
preventing breaches of it among themselves; but the
<i>Craggan nan phidiach</i>,&mdash;the Raven of the Rock of
Glengarry, was of too bold spirit, and too bustling
wing, to be so restrained. To prevent accidents,
this mighty personage, who had stood up bonnetted,
dirked, and pistolled, at the King’s coronation,
to the utter dismay of the ladies of England,
had been sent upon this occasion to keep watch and
ward upon the state-coach; but when the coach
had taken its place in the procession, the chieftain
stepped a little way out of his, bustling through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
crowd to give Mac Mhic Alistair Mhor’s welcome;
and it was not till the Lion of England had knitted
his brows and shaken his mane, that the Raven of
the Rock flew back to her station.</p>

<p>Onward moved the procession, through avenues
of people, and arches of triumph,&mdash;one of which
latter spoke as much as ten volumes upon the learning
of the Athens, and the ignorance of the <i>mercatores</i>
of Leith: “<i>O felicem diem!</i>” said that side
of the first triumphant arch which looked towards
the Athens; “O happy day!” quoth the one which
smiled upon the lack-Latin lieges of Leith.</p>

<p>When the procession had cleared the town of
Leith, and was moving gracefully along that broad
and beautiful walk, which still keeps Leith at a respectful
and proper distance from the Athens, the
first presentation upon Scottish ground was made to
the King&mdash;and perhaps none more honourable in its
spirit, or honest in its intention, was made to him
during his whole sojourn. There was presented to
George the Fourth, a <i>Parliament-cake</i>,&mdash;not such
a cake as is gleaned from the fields of a country, or
baked in the oven of a royal burgh, and thence
sent to St. Stephen’s Chapel as a well-leavened
waive-offering, (and from which, by the way,
Scotland has got by way of eminence the name of
the <i>Land of Cakes</i>,) but something more luscious
and learned still,&mdash;a cake of sweet and spicy ginger-bread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
stamped with all the letters of the alphabet,
and by combination and consequence, with the
whole learning and literature of the united kingdom.
The presentation alluded to happened thus:
Margaret Sibbald, an able-bodied matron of Fisher-Row,
had been induced, through the compound
stimulus of curiosity and loyalty, to leave her home
all unbreakfasted, in order to take her place in the
royal procession; Margaret had stored her ample
leathern pouch with a penny-worth of Parliament-cake,
in order to support nature through this
praise-worthy work; but Margaret’s eyes had been
so much feasted, that Margaret’s stomach was forgotten.
Seeing that the King wore a hue which
she did not consider as the hue of health, and
judging that it might arise from depletion induced
by his rocking upon the waters, she elbowed
her way through horsemen, Highland-men, archer-men,
and official men, up to the royal carriage, and
drawing forth her only cake, held it up to his Majesty,
expressing sorrow that his royal countenance
was so pale, and assuring him that if she had had
any thing better he would have got it. A forward
strippling of the guards charged Margaret sword in
hand, to which Margaret replied, “Ye wearifu’
thing o’ a labster! Ye hae nae mense, I hae dune
mair for the King than you can either do or help
to do; I hae born him sax bonnie seamen as ere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
hauled a rope, or handled a cutlass.” It was, however,
no time for prolonged hostilities, and so Margaret
was lost in the crowd, and the guardsman not
noticed in the procession.</p>

<p>Many were the events of the march ere the King
arrived at the end of Picardy-Place, to receive the
silver keys of the Athens, and hear the silvery tones
of her chief magistrate; I shall mention only one:
The pawky provost of a burgh of the extreme north,
determined to see the whole, and yet not pay his
half-guinea for a seat in one of the booths, had
scrambled to the top of a tree at Greenside-Place,
where he hung rocking like a crow’s nest. As the
King approached, the provost swung himself to
one side, waving his bonnet, and screeching his
huzza, in strains which would have scared all the
owls in England; and when the mass and the
movement of this loyalty were in full effect, they
proved too mighty for the support, so that the
pine and the provost fell prostrate before the King.
Even this was not much heeded: the procession
moved on, and the provost moved off.</p>

<p>At last the King came to the wicker-gate of the
city, the keys were presented, the speech was
spoken, and the crowd in a great measure melted
away, by the majority hurrying away toward the
Calton-Hill, whence they could command a view of
the whole during almost a mile of its march. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
desertion fell like cold water upon the official men,
and even the King himself seemed disappointed.</p>

<p>But the gloom and the disappointment were of
no long duration, for no sooner did he turn the
corner into St. Andrew’s-street, than the mass of
shouting and ecstatic people who hung upon the
whole beetling side of the hill, and covered every
part of the buildings, came upon him with a shock
of joy and a touch of exultation, which made the
cold state of the monarch give way to the warm
feelings of the man. “My God! that is altogether
overpowering!” said he, snatching off his hat and
essaying to join in the cheer, but his voice faltered,
and tears, which were not tears of sorrow, suffused
his eyes, and watered his cheeks.</p>

<p>His reception when he landed had been confined,
and the people were too near for giving vent to
their feelings; and the delivering of the keys,
though there was a crowd there because the King
halted a little, was a piece of mummery, about
which so reflective a people as the Scotch cared
little; but when the King was discerned in Prince’s Street,
when the living hill-side beheld his approach,
and when the assembled nation reflected
that their Monarch was coming in peace to visit
them,&mdash;it was then that Scotland welcomed the
King, with a welcome which none that saw or heard
it is likely ever to forget. The first shout was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
astounding, and it rose and rung till it was answered
by voices of joy over a wide circumference.</p>

<p>During all this time I had not seen the procession,
but I heard of it from one who was close
by the royal person all the time, and whose character
for truth and feeling is recognised as well by
the world of letters as by the world of men. I
must confess that, choice and chosen as was my
place, the occupation of it was a pretty severe trial
on my patience; and when I first saw the yellow
plumes of the Braidalbanes, and the tall and majestic
form of their leader, issuing from behind the
monument of David Hume, and heard the notes of
their bagpipes pealing “the Campbells are coming,”
I had almost wished myself a Highlander, and in
the procession. The King soon arrived at the
Palace, had a hurried interview with some of the
officers of state, and then drove off for Dalkeith-House,
there to pause and recover from the fatigue
of the voyage, and the excitement of the procession.</p>


<p class="pc1 reduct">THE ILLUMINATION, THE LEVEE AND COURT,
AND THE LADIES.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Ten thousand tapers shone; ten thousand lords,<br />
And squires, and yeomen, hungry clerks, and churchmen,<br />
Bended the supple knee; ten thousand ladies,<br />
With eyes of love, lit up the nether skies.”</p>

<p class="pn1">Although each of these, no doubt, seemed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
parties themselves of sufficient importance to add
to the shelves of literature a new volume, instead of
being confined to a single chapter or section, yet I
am induced to bring the three into juxtaposition,
because I shall thereby preserve the unities,&mdash;have
a beginning in light, a middle in somewhat of
gruffness, if not of gloom, and an end as glorious
as the congregated beauty of a whole nation, together
with divers importations, could make it.</p>

<p>It may be thought that the burning of a certain
number of candles, the hanging up of a certain
number of coloured lamps, and the displaying of a
few ill-daubed transparencies, could contain no
trait of national character; and that therefore it
ought to find no place in these pages. But there
was, perhaps, no one scene during the whole solemnity
which brought out the character of the
Scotch more decidedly than the illumination of
Edinburgh upon the evening after that on which
the King landed. The town of Leith had indeed
been both very generally and very finely illuminated
on the evening before; but that haughty spirit of
the Athens which makes her bear herself somewhat
saucily toward all her compatriot (or if you will,
com-<i>provosted</i>) cities and towns in general, and towards
poor Leith in particular,&mdash;that spirit which
made them taunt Leith with the translated side of
the inscription, in the morning, made them reckon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
it high treason against the majesty of the Athens
to look at, or talk of, her illumination in the evening;
and thus, although the thing was no doubt
very fine, there were few to wonder, and still fewer
to put that wonder upon record. When the Athens,
however, hung out her physical lamps, the emblems
of her metaphysical light, all came, all saw, and all
admired. It was a novelty to me: the illumination
was so general, the streets were so thronged, and
the people were so orderly. No doubt, there were
wanting that profusion of daubed transparencies,
and dangling festoons, tagged with classic mottoes
and allusions, ill-quoted and worse applied, which
are found in other places; but here, again, his
Majesty would have had cause to exclaim, that the
nation by which he was surrounded were all ladies
and gentlemen. Excepting at the public buildings,
the houses of official persons, the apartments
of clubs and societies, and the houses of a few private
individuals, the abode of peer and burgher
were illuminated in the same style, and with the
same brilliance. I waive the details as to who
hung up a crown in white lamps, or a thistle in
green and red, or who took up their motto in Latin,
in English, or in Gaelic. I do not even dwell
upon the general effect; for though, on account of
the situations in Edinburgh, the state of the
weather, and the zeal of all classes of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that was as fine as possible,&mdash;it was the people
themselves that were the sight. Natives and visiters,
three hundred thousand of every rank, age,
and sex, thronged the streets to such a degree, that
it was difficult in many of them to get a sight either
of the pavement or the carriage-way. This immense
mass put one very much in mind of bees;
their noise at any point was scarcely louder than
the hum of those insects, and in their varied motions
they clashed as little with each other. Instead
of brawling and wrangling, which almost invariably
take place on such occasions, the most elegant
escaped without a stain, and the most feeble without
a jostle. The accommodation which they afforded
each other in their progress was truly remarkable:
When one came to any of the elevations
so frequent in the streets of Edinburgh, one saw
nothing but human beings, thick and reeling as the
leaves in an autumnal whirlwind; and yet, if one
chose, one’s progress could be as rapid and almost
as free of interruption as if the street had been
deserted. I did not remark a face in the whole assemblage
that did not express the feeling of being
pleased itself, and the desire of communicating
pleasure to all around it. Just as was the case on
the day of his Majesty’s entry, the conduct of the
people was the same as if they had been engaged
in a solemn and felicitous act of religious worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>While the inhabitants of the Athens and their
visiters were thus rejoicing in the light which
themselves had kindled, (a species of joy which,
by the way, is peculiarly congenial to the said
Athenians,) they whispered, as any unknown personage
of sufficient size for a monarch moved
through the crowd, that that personage could be
none other than the king himself in disguise. Indeed,
I am not sure but a considerable portion
of that decorum which marked Edinburgh
upon this occasion was owing to the apprehension
which every body had that the royal eye might be
upon them, without their knowing any thing about
it; but whatever might be the operating principle,
whether a sense of decorum, or national or personal
pride, the effect was equally striking, and the
merit perhaps equally great. But still, though the
illumination, especially when the spirit of the people
is taken into the account, was a fine show, still
it was only a show, and a show in which the king,
or even the Athens, in her peculiar capacity, took
no part, and in which official men cut no more
figure than the common herd.</p>

<p>With the <i>levee</i> it was otherwise: that was one
of the grand acts for which the king had been
invited to Scotland; and it is utterly impossible
to form even an idea of the hopes that were built
upon it. From the very first blush of the business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the regular, thorough-going tories, (which, in Scotland,
mean those who will take any public employment,
and pocket any public money, however
improperly or dirtily got,) fancied that the whole
consequence of the land was to be entwined around
their capacious heads, and the whole wealth of it
crammed into their more capacious pockets; and
thus, they had given themselves airs, at which an
Englishman would have been perfectly thunderstruck.
A very respectable and very independent
proprietor of the county of Fife told me that, a
personage who had acted as tell-tale of their village
during the war, and who, for a long time after the
peace, continued to sell plots (perhaps at a handsome
discount) to the crown lawyers of Scotland,
until the ministry put an end to the unavailing
traffic, would occasionally be found pacing over
his estate, tasting the soil of the fields, and noting
down what he was to have sown in each of them,
after the king should have put him in possession.</p>

<p>The people were quite full of stories of this
kind; and I have no doubt that the desire of seeing
how these men of high loyalty and higher hopes
would act, was one of the chief causes that brought
so many provincial people to the Athens; and that
the humiliation that these persons met with was,
next to the joy at seeing each other happy, one of
the greatest boasts that the whole affair yielded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Without a previous knowledge of the political system
of Scotland,&mdash;the way in which the few vicegerents
in the Athens gobble up the loaves and the
fishes, how lesser men over the country snap at the
crumbs; and how they all growl, and worry, and
snarl at other folks, it is quite impossible to form
an idea of the insolence by which the little men of
office were actuated. As, however, I shall have to
discuss this matter when I come to treat of the
politics of the Athens, (for it is there that the
centre and focus of the system exists,) it would be
both premature and unintelligible to notice them
here. Wherefore, I shall confine myself to what
I saw and heard as touching the levee.</p>

<p>The night which preceded that eventful day was
an anxious and unclosing one to the men of hope
and of office, from all parts of Caledonia; and
baron and bailie, parson, provost, and professor,
great judge and small attorney, eloquent advocate
and uneloquent scribe,&mdash;all that the land of heath, of
herrings, and of black cattle, could produce, was,
with proud but palpitating heart, bedecking and
bedizening itself, in all sorts of dresses, official,
courtly, and nondescript, in order that they might,
in seemly array, kiss that Kaaba of all loyal men’s
worship, (and who would not be a loyal man upon
such an occasion,) the hand of a king. Three
dukes, the same tale of marquesses, sixteen earls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a brace of viscounts, twenty-nine barons, a pair of
right honourables, four great officers of state, sixteen
judges of the land, twenty-two who were honourable,
and eleven who lengthened the fag end
of the Scottish household, were there. Besides
seventy-seven baronets, twelve members of parliament,
thirty-eight lords lieutenant, a hundred
head of provosts, bailies, counsellors, and deacons,
“after their kinds,” with as many parsons, professors,
physicians, and pleaders, as were sufficient
to convert, and cultivate, and cure, from plethora
both of person and of purse, the whole British empire,
together with military men, who had fought
and who had not fought, proprietors or kinsmen
of the soil, and burgesses, “simple persons,”
swelled the amount to not fewer than two
thousand persons, who had to pass in wonderful
procession before the wondering king. When it
was considered, that the whole of this mighty
and motley squad, charged with addresses to the
number of nearly a hundred, each more loyal
and laboured than another, had to pass muster,
and read, and retire, in the space of one brief
hour, it was apparent that the official men of
Scotland would have to dance about and deliver
themselves with somewhat more of alacrity, and
somewhat less of that slow profundity of bowing
than is usually the case. Dreading that the addresses,
from the importance of their contents, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the orthoëpal powers of the readers, would of
themselves have consumed more than a day, it was
wisely resolved, that the persons who were charged
with them should continue enceinte of them till the
Monday, upon which day they should be allowed
to deliver themselves before the throne, or behind
it in the closet, according to their several conditions
and importance; and thus the mighty tide of the
levee was undisturbed by any prosing from parchment,
and undisconcerted by any uncouthness of
provincial speech. The muster of beast-drawn vehicles
was tremendous; and, though the magisterial
equipages were reduced in their number of
cattle, those which they contained never looked so
big in their lives as when they were in progress to
the levee, or so little as when they were fairly
there. A grievous mishap befel their worships
the under-magistrates of Glasgow: The ruler of that
city, who never bought or sold any thing less than
a bale of cotton or a basket of figs, could not be
expected to ride in the same carriage with the
bailies, many of whom were fain to vend a sixpenny
handkerchief, or an ounce of caraway seeds;
so two carriages were prepared, the foremost for
his lordship, and the hindermost for their not-lordships.
The provost entered his state-coach,
and both carriages simultaneously sought their
places in the line of procession; the line threaded
its way to the Holyrood; the provost alighted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
true magisterial dignity, and the door was opened
to let the bailie train come forth of their wagon.
They had vanished! “Whare are my bailie bodies?”
exclaimed the provost; “I knew they were
taking a bit bowl to keep their hearts aboon; but
I didna reckon on their gettin’ fou upon sic an
occasion as this!” His lordship, however, was instantly
relieved by a dozen of chairmen, hurrying
across the area, while a well-known voice was
bawling from each chair, “Whare’s the right and
honourable lord provost o’ the wast?” It would
be endless to recount all the little accidents of this
nature that rippled the swelling waves of official
joy; but it would be unjust not to mention the wig
and staff of Dundee’s principal and vice. The
wig of the principal which, ungainly as it was,
was the most wise-looking thing about him, had
been put under the curling irons before day-break,
and thus was burned and cauterized to the lining
in sundry places. These had been skilfully repaired
with court plaster of the most glossy black;
and thus, in reply to sundry pityings of the lacerated
head of the burgh, the official man was
forced to make it known, that he was of peace-seeking
disposition, and, instead of a broken head,
had only got a burned wig. The staff of the vice
was a matter yet more serious. It had a diamond
head, and the wearer, when at home, contrived to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
poke it under his left arm so skilfully, that it shone
by all the world like the star of the order of the
golden calf, at the button-hole of some foreign
knight. The worshipful gentleman never dreamt
that he would be prevented from bearing this
splendid and symbolic staff into the presence of the
King, and thus, in as far as stars were concerned,
vying in magnitude with the Monarch himself;
but he was sadly disappointed, had to leave the
sacred cudgel in charge of the cook at Mackay’s
Hotel, and thus grope his way to the royal presence
as grim as a dark lantern.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed in breadth of humour,
the countenances of many of Scotland’s important
sons, as they came, with eyes and mouth set wide
to worship and to wonder, into the presence-chamber.
Not a few of them, when they raised
their “leaden eyes that loved the ground,” in
lack-lustre astonishment, from the drab-coloured
drugget which had been nailed down by Mr. Trotter
as fit carpeting for their feet, beheld more
kings than were exhibited to Banquo in the wizard
glass. As is not unfrequent with men whose wits
are neither great, nor altogether at home, not a few
of them mistook the right one; and the portly Sir
William Curtis, who was “dressed in tartan
sheen,” with a kilt marvellously scant in its longitude,
and dangling a bonnet, in which was displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a grey goose feather of the largest size, took
the edge off the loyalty of a full third; while his
great grace of Montrose, who was drudging at the
honours of the day, monopolized another, leaving
only thirty-three and one-third per cent. of the
loyalty of Scotland to be inflicted directly upon
the King. It is needless to tell how brief were the
salutations: there were two thousand persons who
had to make their entrée, their bow, and their exit,
in about a hundred minutes, which was, as nearly
as possible, one second to each act of each person;
and thus, however discordant might be the bearing
of the different <i>bodies</i>, the unity of time was admirably
preserved. The ceremony came upon them
like an electric shock, or rather they came upon it
as moths come upon the flame of a candle,&mdash;a buz,
a singe of the wings, and down they dropt into
insignificance. “Hech, Sirs!” said a brawny
yeoman from the kingdom of Fife, as he attempted
in vain to squeeze his minimum of opera hat upon
his maximum of skull,&mdash;“Hech, Sirs! but its
quick wark this! We might hae gotten a snuff wi’
him at ony rate;” and, as he strode across the
court, and found himself fairly without the great
gate, he fumbled over his head-piece with his paws,
saying, “I’m thankfu’ that it’s upo’ my shouthers
after a’!” Those who attended the civic authorities,
who stuck to each other as closely as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they had been in their council-chambers at home,
wore faces of the most broad and boundless delight;
for, of the men of more ample calibre, the
tories looked blank, because they were elbowed
and perhaps outnumbered by the whigs in the presence
of the King. Some of the clods of the valley
lost themselves in the long galleries and cold corridors
of the Holyrood; and, after all was over,
and the fatigued Monarch had retired to Dalkeith,
a few of them were heard at the windows bawling,
like Sterne’s Starling, “I can’t get out.” So
ended the levee; and the King and the people
rested for the sabbath without any thing of remarkable
occurrence.</p>

<p>On Monday the hearts of the address men were
lifted higher than ever; and, as the rapid and
dumb show in which they passed before the King
on Saturday, had taken off the first and deepest
blush of their bashfulness, they went to the court
in very masterly style: foremost, were a hundred
ministers of the Scotch kirk, supported by about
fifty ruling elders of the same; who, having met
in solemn conclave in the Canon-gate church, said
to be the most composing and soporific in all Edinburgh,
they moved “dark as locusts o’er the land
of Nile” across the sanctuary, not of churchmen
but of insolvent debtors, approached the presence,
bowed themselves with more than priestly reverence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and, by the mouth of David Lamont, D.D.,
their moderator, poured the honey and the oil of
their adulation into the royal ear. Spirit of John
Knox, wert thou then on the watch! and didst
thou mark the silken cords in which thy degenerate
sons were drawn to bend the knee before an earthly
Monarch! Yes, how wouldst thou have exclaimed
that the gold of the zeal of thy church had become
dim, and the fine gold of its independence had
changed, if thou hadst heard thy backsliding children
tempering their temporizing address with the
miry clay of earthly politics, calling the King
“the bulwark of the church,” and promising to
labour, not for the conversion of sinners, or for
the glory of Him whom thou didst account the only
Head of the church, but “to impress upon the
people committed to their care, a high sense of the
invaluable blessings of the glorious and happy constitution?”
But, boldest spirit of the reformation,
be not offended,&mdash;Think on the difference of the
times. The times in which your earthly lot was
cast, were times of wrestling and of reformation,&mdash;they
required the heart of steel, the eye that turns
not aside, and the hand which is never slackened;
but the lines of thy followers have fallen in pleasant
places, they have become full of the fatness of the
earth, and therefore they recline at their ease under
the refreshing shadow of temporal power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Scottish kirk, came, laden with wisdom,
the members of the four Scottish universities;
and this having been done, the remaining individuals
and classes of men who were charged with
courtly sayings, disburthened themselves in the
closet behind the throne; and the paper thus accumulated,
having been deposited for use, this act
of the drama closed, leaving less upon the memory
than had been anticipated.</p>

<p>The monarch having thus opened a levee for
the honour of his Scottish subjects generally, and
allowed her official men to drop their honeyed papers
and parchments at the court and in the closet,&mdash;having
devoted two whole days to the hard hands
of country lairds, and the greasy lips of parsons
and bailies, it was naturally to be concluded, that
he would be pretty well saturated of salutation
from the men of Scotland, and long for the approach
of Scottish women, as the traveller, in the
sandy desert, longs for the green spot and the
glassy spring. Nor could the desire have been
wholly confined to his majesty. The anxiety of
the Scottish fair was bent, like the bow of Diana
when the arrow is drawn to the barbs; their
preparations, positive and negative, for this
high honour, had been long, laborious and self-denying;
and they were not without feeling that
four whole days should not have interposed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
twelve-month-looking-lengths between the sight and
salutation of their King. It is true, that in Scotland
generally, and in the Athens in particular,
woman, that grand barometer of civilization, has of
late risen many degrees. The time has not long
gone by, at which females were mere beasts of
burden in rural affairs, and young girls were in
many places obliged to ply as ferry-boats. I myself
have seen half a score of stout and sinewy
Highlanders lying snuffing upon a hillock of manure,
while their wives and daughters were bearing
heavy baskets of the same to the fields, while all
that the lords of the creation condescended to do
was to fill the baskets; and I have been&mdash;no, I
have not been, I was only offered to be&mdash;carried
across sundry Highland rivers, upon the shoulders
of the fairest nymphs which adorned their banks.
But the Athens has got the better of all this, and
her daughters have not only reduced the tyranny
of their husbands to “flytings” and frailties, but
have learned to pay them back with interest even
in these. Thus the delay which had taken place in
consequence of the grand parade of the men, and
the small extra drill of the official men, by no
means tended to lessen the commodity of curtain-lectures.
There were other causes of vexation:
the means by which a sufficiency of beauty had
been procured were more precious than permanent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the delay of hope not only made the heart sick, but
tended to pucker the skin, and, what was more
vexatious than all, these careful dames, after they
had trimmed themselves for the royal salute, would
submit themselves to the salutation of no mere
man in the interim. Wherefore, if any casualty
had prevented this glorious feast, or even protracted
it, the <i>primum mobile</i> of the city might
have stood still, and the Athens might have been
the Athens no more.</p>

<p>It being the only time during a century and a
half, at the least, when the daughters of Scotia
have had the flattering opportunity of flaunting
their trains, flourishing their plumes, bowing in the
presence of Majesty, and, finally, giving their
cheeks to the glory and honour of the royal basial
salutation,&mdash;and certainly the only time when a
native royal drawing-room has been held in Scotland,
since she had either much wealth or population
to display,&mdash;it is not to be wondered at, that it
produced corresponding anxiety among the fair.
A random female here and there may, no doubt,
have been in the royal presence, and there may be
one or two cheeks which have before been made
happy by the royal impress; but the greater, by
far the greater part of the roses and lilies of Scotland
were, up to this happy 21st of August, 1822,
in virgin, but pitiable, ignorance of so much honour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
It is not to be wondered at, then, that the preparations
of this eventful day had their sources remote
in the past, and the hopes of the fair ones groped
their way far into the future; and if they had not
made themselves gay upon the occasion, it would
have been alien alike to the honour of their country
and the disposition of the sex. Morning, noon,
and night, had accordingly been spent at the
mirror, and many a projection has been squeezed,
and furrow smoothed, in order that for “Scotland’s
glory,” and their own, they might appear as
splendid, as gay, and as bewitching as possible, in
the presence of their King and his nobles, and their
own admirers. All this was most laudable; and as
the fair ones, with their eyes, their candles, and
their mirrors, literally frightened the reign of “old
Night,” they merited forgiveness though they encouraged
a little of that of “Chaos.”</p>

<p>So much of the fire of Scotland’s moral electricity,
moving in such prime conductors, could
not be supposed to confine either itself or its effects
to the earth. Ere grey dawn, the sky wept at
the eclipse of so many of its moons and stars by
the radiance of the Venuses and Lunas of the
Athens rising to their culmination; and, as it had
not recovered in the morning, there was somewhat
of pains-taking and pouting ere the coaches and
chairs could receive the whole of their delectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
burthens. Still, however, the ceremony was one
which could not be put off, and so the ocean-swell
of beauty collected, and nathless the drizzling rain,
poured its eager tide toward the palace. When
they arrived at the entrée-room, some of the colloquies
which they held with each other were not
a little amusing. If I could judge from the general
strain of what I heard of them, the kiss&mdash;the
downright and <i>bona fide</i> smack at royalty, without
any of the leaven even of suspicion in it, was the
thing which pleased them the most. Each was
making sure too, (for there is a wonderful foresight
in the women of Scotland as well as in the men,)
that the jealousy which this high honour would
excite, would procure a goodly harvest of future
salutation. Some female Humes (not in name
but in nature,) were propounding “sceptical
doubts” upon the subject; and stating, with tears
in their eyes, and terror on their brows, their apprehension,
that it would be “but a sham
after a’.”</p>

<p>One great object with the Caledonian fair seemed
to be to prevent, as much as they could, the possibility
of the ceremony’s being bungled, through
the youth or inexperience of those who were to
apply it. It had indeed been rumoured that the
King hated all lips but such as had been mellowed
by the suns, and mollified by the frosts, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
forty seasons, and that young girls, as smelling of
bread and butter, were peculiarly offensive to the
royal organs; whereupon it was said, that the
young maidens of Scotland were enjoined to abstain
from the ceremony altogether, and that the
full grown ones abstained from bread and butter
during the whole period of their drill.</p>

<p>In consequence, while there never was a royal
drawing-room so fresh and new in the dresses and
ignorance of the fair attendants, there never perhaps
was one in which the appearance of those
attendants themselves was more sage and matured.
Every lonely tower, in a remote glen, around whose
grey battlements the hollow wind had whistled,
“Nobody coming to marry me,” for more returnings
of the falling leaf than it would be seemly to
mention, poured forth its tall and time-learned
damsels,&mdash;erewhile as grey as its walls, but now
as green as the lichen with which they are incrusted,
and as gorgeous as the sun whose beams
find out the old tower the more easily, and gild
them the more copiously, in proportion to the
leaflessness of all around. With those mingled
the dowagers and despairers of George’s Square,
upon the thresholds of whose doors, and the graves
of whose hopes, the grass had for more than moons
waxed green apace. Nor were there wanting a few
of somewhat more juvenile an aspect; abundance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of manœuvring dames, who had exposed the
precious wares of their own manufacture at all the
marts and bazaars in the island; with other languishing
and loving ladies whose number it were
difficult to count.</p>

<p>But, in their zeal to suit the royal taste in the
maturity of the greater part of the muster, they
had rather overshot the mark. If the tale of that
taste says sooth, the word “forty,” which is to be
found in every country, and which, in single dignity
and desire, is found more abundantly in Scotland,
and especially in the Athens, than in any
country, is preceded by the words “fat and fair,”
which, in that land, and pre-eminently in that city,
are among the <i>desiderata</i>. Hence, there perchance
was never collected before a pair of royal eyes so
many tall, gaunt, and ungainly figures, and never
offered to the salutation of a pair of royal lips, so
many sunken and sinewy cheeks. In their costumes,
they were uncommonly splendid: sweeping
trains of white satin, over spangled robes of various
fancies, (in nowise emblematical of “white without
and spotted within,”) were the predominant
costumes; and, in number and in magnitude, the
plumes of feathers which waved and nodded above,
might have furnished all the beds, bolsters, and
pillows, to the court of Og, the giant king of Bashan.
In the dresses, too, there were all the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of contrast with the wearers: the one were
as fresh and as new as the others were furrowed
and old. And this did not escape the discriminating
eye of the King, who, though he prudently
abstained from all commendation on the score of
beauty, was copious on that of cleanliness.</p>

<p>In their previous estimate of the royal taste, they
had not calculated with their usual wisdom. To
the more sage and skinny dames, the appulse was so
slight and so brief, that before the agitation was
over, the impression was gone; and, of the whole
that attended, only one little and lovely girl could
boast of a palpable and positive kiss.</p>

<p>I could not help being struck with the extreme
solemnity of the whole. There was none of that
jaunty lightness of step, and that soft and flexible
twining of body, which I have remarked on similar
occasions in other places. The whole moved on,
solemn and erect, as though it had been the Scotch
Greys approaching to a charge, or the Forty-second
to a crossing of bayonets. Their features expressed
intelligence in many instances, and pride
in all, but I saw not such that I could call beauty.
Their looks were highly characteristic: they were
staid even to demureness, and they sailed toward
the state apartment without a single movement of
the eyes, or any thing which could be called a
smile upon the countenance. Never perhaps did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
so great and so mingled an assembly of females display
so much modesty,&mdash;modesty too which was
not the modesty of subdued fire, but that of coal
which seemed capable of resisting all powers of
ignition. In the elder ones, the mouth had a
character which no one could overlook: the days
of labour which had been spent in giving plumpness
to the lip were, in a great measure, rendered
unavailing, by the force with which the corners of
the mouth were drawn back, and the firmness with
which its thread-like furnishings were brought together.
It seemed indeed that they had been
anxious to bring as much of this commodity to the
solemnity, and set it apart as exclusively as possible
for the use of their sovereign; for, fearful of
deficiency in plumpness and breadth, they had
laboured to make up for it in an extension of
length; and two deep and decided curves, hedged
it in, as though for the time it had been parenthetical,&mdash;set
apart to the service of the King, and fortified
by fosse and rampart against all the rest of
the world.</p>

<p>The space which could be allotted to each for
the doing of a salutation was excessively brief; and
what with the solemnity of the ladies, and the
scowling of the heavens, it had more the air of a
funeral procession than of a festive assembly.
When it was over, or perhaps a little before, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
daughters of Caledonia found out, that though
they could be gorgeous at a drawing-room, they
could not be gay. They did not indeed look like
“fishes out of the water;” but they looked like
fishes that had never been in it. It was so novel in
itself, and they had so exhausted themselves in the
preparation, that the parade itself was gloomy;
and though it furnished abundant evidence of the
existence of high talents and higher pride among
them, it also afforded proof that time and change
would neither be idle nor in haste, if they were to
be thoroughly prepared for gliding and glittering
at court.</p>

<p>Themselves and their male relatives seemed indeed
to have been aware of this,&mdash;to have known
that there was another and more appropriate arena
for the displaying of them to advantage; and,
though it had not been set forth in the gazette,
I could have discovered, from the looks of speculation
that were quietly exchanged in the proximity,
and even in the presence of majesty, that there
would be a chapter of the Highland fling. Those
tender telegraphings were as new to me as any part
of the proceedings; and they led me to observe the
unique and characteristic nature of a modern
Athenian ogle.</p>

<p>The Athenian damsels, or dames, as it happens,
cannot have so many of the soft propensities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
flesh as their more plump neighbours of the south,
not having so much flesh wherein the same may be
contained; but, from all that I could discover,
they have not, upon the whole, less of the <i>mater
amoris</i> in them; and being a more firm and substantial
matter&mdash;more “bred in the bones” as it
were, it is perchance more deep and more durable.
Thus, while the dimple of an English cheek
tells its soft tale of love, the jutting angle of an
Athenian cheek-bone hints at the same; and there
is often more amatory demonstration in a single
Caledonian wrinkle, than in all the blushes of the
most blooming dame southward of the Tweed.
The extreme vigilance, too, with which the ladies
of the Athens watch each other, and especially the
cat-like lurkings which the plain and decaying have
for those who have more of the species and are
more in the season of bloom, gives a wariness to
the character of every woman within that metropolis,
and makes even the most accredited and
creditable love an affair of mystery and intrigue.
If a gentleman is detected walking with or speaking
civilly to one lady, eyes, from loop-holes of
which he dreams not, are instantly upon him, and
the affair is handed about from coterie to coterie,
as a marriage, or as something worse; while, if he
is seen with two or more, he is a Don Juan of the
first magnitude, and they, “poor dear lost things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
are&mdash;very much to be pitied indeed.” So far as I
know, they have no tendency to pity themselves in
such cases; but this may be the very reason why
they have so much of it to spare to their neighbours.</p>

<p>This propensity could not be restrained even by
the counter-excitation of the royal presence; and
while everybody upon whom the King was pleased
to smile at the shows (and he was graciously pleased
to smile upon a great number) was <i>pitied</i>, or, as
it might have been, <i>envied</i>, as the object of regal
flirtation, those blowsy country sisters and cousins,
whom awkward accountants and spruce scribes kept
lumbering along the streets upon the resting days,
were, in the bitterness of the Athenian anguish,
set down as spouses soon to be.</p>

<p>A handsome young gentleman from the south,
whose form promised love, and whose appearance
bespoke the wherewithal to support it, had brought
down his mother and three sisters to amuse themselves,
and see the sights. The matron, though
her family were come to what are in the Athens
termed the “years of discretion,” has still as much
bloom as half a score of the six-flight-of-stairs
virginity of that city; and, it so happened, that
there was no family resemblance either in form or
features among the young people. The gentleman
appeared at one place with his mother, at another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
place with one or other of his sisters, sometimes
with two, and sometimes with the whole; and the
quantity of speculation, and wonder, and pity, and
lamentation, which his so appearing excited, would
have drained the tears, and exhausted the words of
fifty Jeremiahs.</p>

<p>All those circumstances are enough, and more
than enough, to impose upon the amatory signals
of the Athenians a closeness and caution, of which
those who live in a more free and liberal state of
society can form no conception; and while they
thus force the people to put on the semblance of
intrigue where there is no necessity for it, they at
the same time forward the reality of intrigue in
cases of which perhaps scarcely another people
would dream; and thus, in consequence of the very
rigour of the external laws of decorum, the Athenians
are, perchance, in fact and in secret, the
most indecorous in the whole island of Great Britain,&mdash;the
which would lead one fond of scandal
and of similies to conclude, that the white trains
and the spangled robes were not chosen in vain;
but I am a novice in both, and therefore I shall say
nothing about the matter.</p>

<p>The exhibition of faces and forms, and the actual
contact with royalty, not being sufficient either to
show off or to satisfy the ladies of Scotland, they
resolved to make the general attack upon the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with their heels; and, as the Athens contained no
hall ample enough for showing off the whole at
once, and further, as the same parties might be
shown off twice under different appellations, once
as the planets of the peerage, and again as the
comets of Caledonia, the assembly rooms in George
Street were destined to be twice trodden by the
same feet, in the two enactings of the Peers’ ball,
and the Caledonian ball. These were not consecutive;
but it will be no great anachronism to
bring them together.</p>

<p>The Peers’ ball took place in the assembly rooms,
on the evening of Friday the 23d of August; and,
as there the people were more at home, and more
employed than in the merely state ceremonies, its
effect was at once more pleasing and more characteristic.</p>

<p>The portico of the rooms was tastefully illuminated,
the columns being wreathed, and the pediments
outlined, with golden-tinted lamps,&mdash;the
emblems of royalty shining in the centre. The
pillars in the ante-room were twined with flowers,
surmounted by emblematical tablets, over which
the dome glowed with coloured lights. The principal
room, tea-room, and refectory, were very
handsome: the first had a platform and throne,
covered with crimson; the second was ornamented
with paintings, in water-colour; and the third was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
well stored with viands. The whole was simple,
but there was an air of freshness, neatness, and
good taste about it. At rather an early hour, say
eight o’clock, the elegantes began to pour in, and
the people to throng to the adjoining street, in
order to catch a glimpse of their fair forms and
nodding plumes. By nine o’clock, the rooms were
completely filled, and the downy feathers which
now reeled to and fro in mid air, with the mingling
darker lines of the other sex, and the sheen of
tartan and gold lace, and ribbon, and star, and
spangle, waved “like wave with crest of sparkling
foam.” If Scotland had honour from the general
appearance and conduct of the people upon
this occasion, she had glory in her daughters.
If they had not the light heart and laughing eye
of the daughters of the south, they were fully equal
to them in dignity and intellectual beauty. Their
dresses were elegant rather than splendid, and their
movements had perhaps as much of stateliness as
of grace. The sustained and chastened joy which
they all displayed, and the keen glance of intellect
and national pride, which mingled with their mirth,
threw an interest over it, which is unknown in lands
of lighter skies, and warmer suns. The noblemen
and gentlemen were in every variety of dress (meaning,
of course, every elegant variety). The duke of
Hamilton was splendidly attired in the Douglas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
tartan. And <i>Mac Cailin Mhor</i> was most conspicuous
in the broad bands of the <i>Sliabh nan
Diarmid</i>. The chiefs, too, were in their various
tartans; but Sir William appeared in a plain court
suit, abandoning the applying of “the kelt aërial
to his Anglian thighs,” with as much care as he
would watch not to let “lignarian chalice, filled
with oats, his orifice approach.” His majesty came
at half after nine, just when the rooms were in the
height of their splendour. He was greeted with a
cheer by the people outside, and most respectfully
received by those within. He remained about an
hour, and then retired. Immediately after his
departure, the company passed to the supper-room
by sections, but without any distinction of
rank.</p>

<p>I detail not the dancing, of which, by the way,
there was much less than of promenading; but, in
general, they were national enough, to “eschew
both waltz and quadrille, and addict themselves to
the good old orthodox fling.” In this their favourite
and characteristic movement, they showed
equal firmness of foot and flexture of limb; and
though the room thinned a little upon his majesty’s
departure, the evolutions were continued till full
three hours beyond the “keystane o’ night’s black
arch,” and thus, according to every canon of
witchery, the charms of the ladies were overpowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and triumphant. Notwithstanding the great
concourse of people, and the closeness with which
they were wedged together, there was no confusion;
and though a guard of cavalry was in readiness,
it was not in the slightest degree required.</p>

<p>The Caledonian Hunt ball, which followed some
evenings afterwards, had little of novelty in it,
further than that the hunters were habited in a
new uniform of royal invention; and that a sort of
cage of brass wire permitted the whole wondering
and waltzing charms of Scotland to view the King;
and at the same time prevented them from pressing
upon him with that ardent closeness which had
oppressed and overheated the royal person upon
the former occasion. This ball closed what may
be considered as the exhibition of the King to the
people of Scotland generally; and with it, I shall
close this long Section.</p>

<p>The pilgrimage from the Holyrood to the castle,
and by Princes Street back to the Holyrood,
seemed, to judge from the state of the weather, to
be peculiarly alarming or offensive to the “prince
of the power of the air,” as well as to the monarch
of the British isles. In all the former doings there
had been something beyond the mere parading
in the street. The procession from Leith was a
matter of necessity, and furthermore it was exceedingly
novel and interesting in itself; the levee, the
court, and the drawing-room, were part of the
usual machinery of the state; the court before the
throne, and the closet behind, for the receipt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
addresses, “according to their generations,” were
what the addressing parties could not have been
happy without, and though these had been disappointed
of the honours and rewards which they
had fondly expected would result at the time, yet
they fondly hoped that they had “done a do”
which would lead to great things in the sequel;
and even the dances had brought folks together,
and might also have their fruits thereafter; but
that the King should be drawn along the whole
length of the Cannon-gate and High Street, work
his way through the ugly gates and awkward passages
to the half-moon battery of the castle, then
pull off his hat, give three cheers in concert with
the bawlings of the crowd, and then go back to
Holyrood by a more circuitous route, was so profound
a piece of wisdom,&mdash;so much a masterstroke
of the good taste of the Great Unknown,
and the sage politics of the Athenian tories, as to
be by much too deep even for royal comprehension.
It seemed too, that none of those counsellors which
the King had taken with him from England could
fathom its profundity. Sir William Curtis indeed
pleaded the lord mayor of London’s pilgrimages
to Kew and Rochester Bridge, as being precedents
exactly in point; but those who knew the etiquette
of courts better, scouted all precedents which could
originate within Temple Bar,&mdash;partly, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
originate with those who arrogate to themselves
the power of closing that gaping portal against the
King, and, partly, because nothing possessed in
the city is at all acceptable but its money. The
King himself scouted the pilgrimage as a piece of
idle foolery: declared, that he had seen the assembled
people in his progress to the palace; that he
had received the noblemen, gentlemen, official
men, and addressing men, at levees and courts;
that he had sustained a general attack of the ladies
at the drawing-room, and sundry particular attacks
at the dances; and that, if his Scottish subjects
were not yet satisfied with gazing at him, he would
hold other levees and other drawing-rooms, till the
humblest boors, burghers, and baillies, with their
wives, should pass muster before him, provided it
were done as a King ought to do such things, in
his state apartments at Holyrood; but, that to
have him shown along the streets, as they would
show an elephant or a prize ox, would be a degradation
both to himself and his subjects. Having,
as was said, expressed himself thus, he sped away
for Dalkeith with even more than wonted alacrity,
wishing that he could be permitted to spend his
days in a way somewhat more agreeable to good
sense and his own inclinations.</p>

<p>The pilgrimage had, however, been resolved on,
and those bodies which it was judged expedient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that the King should wonder at, in their collective
capacities, had clubbed their half-guineas, and
erected their booths along the whole line of the
High Street; and as all this had been done without
consulting the King, it was resolved to <i>boo</i> and
beseech him into compliance. The King, who had
previously known the persevering nature of the
political “seekers” of the Athens, judged that the
easiest way would be to comply with their request,
although, during the whole pilgrimage, I thought
he appeared to feel that what his politeness had
made him content to do, could add nothing to his
kingly dignity.</p>

<p>By this time I had become so little apprehensive
of arrowless bows, and dirks never intended to be
unsheathed, and so much accustomed to tartans
and tails, that I pushed myself into the very centre
of the procession; and as there was nothing better
I could do, I contrived, by putting a bold face
upon it, and huzzaing, as well to demonstrate my
loyalty as to keep myself warm in the rain, to proceed
to the rampart of the half-moon battery, close
by the side of the King.</p>

<p>As this was the occasion upon which the <i>people</i>
of the Athens were to make their nearest approach
to their Sovereign, the preparations for it were correspondingly
general. Notwithstanding the unpropitiousness
of the morning, the streets, booths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
windows, and house-tops, were thronged at an
early hour. The members of all the trades, corporations,
and friendly societies, came pressing to
the line of the progression by about eleven, and
formed a double line for the progress, each well-dressed,
and armed with a white wand; behind
them, in varied phalanx, was that part of the <i>posse
comitatus</i> which could not afford to pay for windows
or seats, and here and there stood a special
constable, or Fifeshire yeoman, mounted. Outside,
the ten-storied houses of the High Street were
tapestried with human faces; and to prevent disturbance,
all the cross-streets were filled by cavalry.
About one, the procession began to form in the
area of Holyrood, and the progress commenced a
little after two. The procession was formed of
nearly the same individuals who composed that on
the King’s landing, and they held nearly the same
places. There was one addition, however, which
excited a good deal of interest: the ancient regalia
of Scotland, the <i>crown</i>, said to have been made for
the Bruce and thus doubly dear as a national relic,
and the sceptre and sword of state. The regalia
were borne immediately in front of the royal carriage.
First, the sword of state, borne by the
Earl of Morton, in lord-lieutenant’s uniform; then
the Sceptre, by the Hon. John Morton Stuart, second
son to the Earl of Moray; and last, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
crown, by the Duke of Hamilton, in right of the
Earldom of Angus.</p>

<p>During the whole progress along the High-Street
it rained, and thus the spectacle was a good
deal injured; but still, the immense crowd of people,
their orderly conduct, their happy faces, the
immense height at which some of them were posted,
the gorgeous array of the cavalcade, and, as much
as any thing, the antique grandeur of the street,
had a fine effect. The King was every where
greeted by shoutings, not loud, but sustained; and
he conducted himself with dignity. Next to the
King, the object of attention was the Duke of
Hamilton, who was cheered along the whole line,
partly on his own account, and partly from his
carrying the ancient symbol of Scottish independence.
It was well that the first time that symbol
was borne publicly in the streets of the Scottish
capital, after having been missing for a century,
should have been in the hands of a nobleman who
feels for, and supports the remnant of that independence.
The robes of the Lord Lyon were so
fine, and his coronet so showy, that he was by
many of the people mistaken for the King; nor
did the beautiful black barb which bore the Knight
Mareschal want his due share of admiration.</p>

<p>Upon the King’s leaving the Cannon-gate, and
passing the building where, in English, in Latin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and in Greek, is recorded the escape of John Knox
from assassination, several buxom and well-dressed
damsels scattered flowers in the street, the music in
the mean time playing the King’s Anthem. The
Tron-kirk and St. Giles’ successively tingled their
bells, and every thing demonstrated the satisfaction
of the people. The <i>bodies</i> which had their
booths about St. Giles’ now did reverence, and
lifted their voices just as his Majesty was passing
over the spot which long groaned beneath the
mass of the Heart of Mid-Lothian. When the
King had arrived at the Castle-Hill, the procession
turned aside, and he passed between the assembled
<i>counties</i>, who were very fervent in their demonstrations
of joy. He alighted on a platform covered
with crimson, received the keys from the Governor,
returned them, walked over the draw-bridge with a
few of his train, was received there by the grenadiers
of the 66th, entered his carriage, (all his attendants
on foot,) and drove to the Half-Moon
battery, where, from a platform erected for the
occasion, it was hoped that he would have enjoyed
a <i>coup-d’œil</i> of the whole loyalty and beauty of
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The day, however, was very unfavourable, a fog
shrouded the city, and it rained heavily; still, the
King stood up, waved his hat, and spoke to the
people, while the cannon from the lower batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of the Castle, and from the Calton-Hill, and Salisbury
Craggs, told the news. Dark as was the
scene, it was most sublime. Through one opening
of the clouds, one could catch a glimpse of Arthur’s
Seat; through another, the smoke of a cannon
from the Craggs, and through a third, some
tower or turret of the city. Among these, by
the way, the finest is the monument erected in
St. Andrew’s-Square, to the late Lord Melville.
It is a fluted Doric column, with a rich base and
capital, and most appropriately surmounted by a
bee-hive, in testimony, doubtless, of the countless
friends and relatives for whom the noble lord had
the means of providing. When the King had
escaped from the pleasure of this inspection, he
filed off for Dalkeith-House, and the <i>pecus</i>, who
had been ducked and delighted, retired to evaporate
the external moisture by moisture within.
The <i>plebs</i> of different places have different modes
of expressing their joy or their grief; those of the
Athens, whatever be their rank or denomination,
and whether in weal or in woe, close the most
social as well as the most sad of their exhibitions,
by pouring out a drink-offering, and pouring it out
abundantly.</p>

<p>I must now say something of that act of the
royal drama in which the official and loyal men of
Scotland gave, before the King, ocular demonstration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of how substantially they could eat, and how
copiously they could drink. Eating and drinking
are, in all civilized countries, and more especially,
perhaps, in the British dominions, so closely allied
with loyalty, that the bason and the bowl would
perhaps be its most appropriate symbols. Corporations
have ever been pre-eminent for those demonstrations
of support to the throne; and as the
Athenian corporation is pre-eminent among corporations
in the northern part of this island, so the
feastings of that corporation have ever been the
fullest and the fattest.</p>

<p>A feast of the corporation of the Athens is a
thing altogether different from a feast of the corporation
of London. In both places it is, no
doubt, more sentient than sentimental; and the
belly must be put to sleep ere the soul be awakened
to heroic deeds; but a feast of the corporation of
London is, notwithstanding all its abundance, a
merely plebeian thing,&mdash;it emanates from the people,
is partaken of by the people, and if royal or
courtly persons be there, they are in the humble
attitude of guests. It is a matter, in short, not
only different from, but in opposition to, those
cold collations which obtain in the kingly circles;
and it is calculated to inspire the people more
with sentiments of independence, and a consciousness
of their own worth, than with that bowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
down of the honour for the sake of rising in office,
and that beggaring of the heart for the sake of
filling the purse with the gains of office, which invariably
accompany banquets of exclusive loyalty.
The feastings of the Athenian corporation, on the
other hand, are feastings which the people do not
originate, and of which they are not allowed to
partake. They are of two kinds,&mdash;which may be
distinguished as well as characterized by the two
epithets of “dinners of the flagon,” and “dinners
of the scrip;” the former having reference to
nothing else than the filling of the belly, the latter
having an ultimate view to the replenishing of the
purse. The feast of the flagon is by much the more
ancient; it is characteristic of the whole genus of
corporation men; and it is because they have a
much greater propensity to feed the flesh than
either to cultivate or to exercise the understanding,
that corporations are every where denominated
<i>bodies</i>,&mdash;as much as to say, that though they may
have souls, these are not worth taking into the account.
In ancient times, when kings held their
regular courts in Scotland, and when these eclipsed
all that could be done by the delegated moons of
the Athenian corporation, that corporation had the
same leaning toward the people which other corporations
near the seat of royalty are supposed to
possess, and in those days the feast of the flagon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was almost the only one known to the corporation
men of the Athens. Now, however, as the royal
household in Scotland has become a mere cipher,
and since the second-hand vessels into which the
delegation of the royal authority has been poured
have become such as not easily to be contaminated
by any association, the feasts of the scrip&mdash;a sort of
clubbing of stomachs and of tongues among all the
Attic worthies, have come into use, more and more
in proportion as the times have been more and more
trying and troublesome, and the price of the expression
of loyalty has been enhanced, upon the
ground of its alleged scarcity;&mdash;since this has
been the case, a complete separation has taken place
even in the feasts of the flagon, between the corporated
bodies and the uncorporated spirits of the
Athens; and in this the “bodies” have found
ample compensation, in the greater frequency of
their own peculiar gastronomizings, as well as in
the tagging of themselves to the tails of the Lord-President,
the Lord-Advocate, and the Lord knows
who&mdash;keeper for the time being of the secret influence
of Scotland,&mdash;who at all times form the
tripod upon which the incense-pot of Scottish
loyalty is sustained.</p>

<p>No better idea of the nature and occasions of
the feasts of the flagon can be given than the well-known
one of the bell-rope of the Tron Kirk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
For many years, a bell, which had been carefully
cracked lest the sound of it should disturb the
official men, whose evening retreats were deeply
buried in the different closes, was tolled at the
tenth hour of every night to warn the populace
from the streets, for fear they should interrupt the
march of that puissant corps of the city-guard,
who paraded the streets after that hour with bandy
legs and battle-axes, to conduct such of the lieges
as could afford to pay for it to any place of amusement
they had a mind to visit. Nightly exercise
had worn the rope by which this bell was put in
motion: it broke one evening, and fell upon the
head of a bailie who was passing, rebounded from
that without doing any damage, but floored an
Athenian damsel who was under his worship’s protection.
This was, of course, not to be borne;
wherefore, a council was summoned, and a feast of
the flagon ordered; and when they had made
themselves happy, they resolved to adjourn till
that day se’nnight, at which time they were to meet
and feast again, and receive estimates as to the
expense of purchasing a new rope and of splicing
the old one. Having dined a second time, they
read the estimates, which were half-a-crown for the
new rope, and eighteen pence for splicing the old.
A matter of so much importance could not be settled
at one meeting of council; wherefore, a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
adjournment and a third dinner were resolved
upon. After that third dinner, the tavern-bill,
thirty-three pounds, six shillings, and eight pence,
for each of the three dinners, and the two estimates
as aforesaid, were laid upon the table. The treasurer
of the city was ordered first to pay the
tavern-bill, and then to give orders that the old
rope should be spliced, because that would be a
saving of the public revenue, of which as faithful
stewards, they ought to be provident. The feasts
of the scrip, again, are different,&mdash;bearing a great
resemblance to those associations of placemen, parsons,
and public stipendiaries, who from time to
time meet all over the country, and spend the price
of a dinner with the same intention, and to the
same effect, that a farmer sprinkles grain in the
furrows of his field,&mdash;that in due time it may yield
an abundant increase. During the war, no sooner
was a victory heard of, than away flew those supporters
of the Crown to a tavern, bumpered and
bawled, till their loyalty and every thing else appeared
double, and then trotted off to beg a share
of the honour and emolument. If a tax or a
scarcity pressed sore upon the people, those persons
were at their dining again, partly with a view of
diminishing the quantity of provision that might
fall into the hands of the enemy; partly because
themselves are ever more courageous in their cups;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and partly because a report of their doings at a
dinner would sound much better than a report of
their doings any where else.</p>

<p>Men who had thus from time immemorial rested
not only their civic and their political importance,
but almost their civic and political existence, upon
their capacity for dining, in whom it was most
likely the greatest wisdom to do so, could not be
expected to let his Majesty eat his venison and
drink his <i>Glenlivet</i> (which unfortunately had been
both furnished by a Whig) at his ease in Dalkeith-House,
but would needs have him see with his own
eyes with what zeal they could cut into a buttock
of beef, and with what alacrity they could drain a
goblet of wine, for the glory and the establishment of
his throne. Accordingly, as the following Sunday
would be a day of rest, the civic and other authorities
in the Athens resolved that a feast of fat
things should be furnished forth in the great hall
of the Athenian Parliament House, upon Saturday
the 24th of August. In preparing the hall for
this occasion, not only had the whole of the Athens
been spoiled of its decorations, but they had been
forced to borrow largely at all the loyal houses in
the vicinity. And as it was in old times the custom
for every guest at the humbler Scottish parties
to be provided with his own spoon, his own knife,
and his own pair of five-pronged forks, so upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
present occasion it might be said, that each noble
or loyal visiter lent his ice-pail or his pepper-box.
This hall, which is as it were the vital principle of
the Athens, the place where the tongues of all her
speakers are loosed, the pockets of all her quibblers
filled, the curiosity of all her gossips gratified, and
the eyes and wishes of all her fair directed&mdash;was made
more gay than ordinary for the occasion; and in the
selection of guests, so far as that could be controlled,
care was taken that none should be present who
could in any wise eclipse in wisdom, or in elegance,
the loyal lords of Scotland and of the Athens.
Feasting, however motley and contrasted the
feasters, is not a subject to be written about, but,
as is perhaps the case with music and with painting,
it is a mere matter of temporary sensation.
Still, however, those who know the strange materials
out of which an Athenian corporation is
formed, (and I shall tell those who do not know
by and by,) can easily conceive what an ungainly
breadth of delight the lower extremities of that
corporation would feel in being allowed to gorge
themselves till their buttons were starting again, in
the very presence of the King. It was pleasing
for them, too, to hear the notes of flutes and fiddles
issuing from those crypts and holes about the hall
whence no sounds are accustomed to issue but the
dronings of the law. The King, with his selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
(I am not bound to say select) guests, had a sort
of line of partition, but all “below the salt,”
there seemed to be no law of aggregation. The
man who had fought at almost every degree of the
earth’s circumference sat in close juxtaposition
with him who had warred merely with words; he
who had done what in him lay to pull down the
glory of the old Athens, was amid those who would
copy that glory for the new; the sinecurist was at
the very ear of him by whom all sinecures are denounced;
he who had ploughed the wave was
companion to him who had only tilled the ground;
and the peer and the bailie were on the most
friendly footing. Nor was the varied <i>status</i> in life
and expression of countenance, the only thing
which gave richness to the harmony. The sober
blush of the heads of the Kirk, and the sombre
gowns of the Edinburgh magistrates, made a fine
contrast with the brightness of stars and ribbons,
and epaulettes and lace, and the mingling colours
of the Celtic chiefs. There were not many in the
Highland garb: the Earl of Fife, Sir Even Mac
Gregor, and the Macdonald, were the only three
that fell under my inspection; and from the number
of uniforms that every where predominated,
the party had a good deal of a military air.</p>

<p>In the arrangements too, the senses of the civic
authorities, which are not upon any occasion very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
great, appeared to be a little bewildered; for there
was no page to carry a bumper from the royal cup
to the Mordecais “whom the King delighted to
honour.”</p>

<p>The only peculiarity of the feast, apart from the
number and variety of the guests, was the <i>reddendo</i>
of William Howison Craufurd, of Braehead, who
came with a basin and water, that his majesty
might wash his hands immediately after he had
satisfied himself of the dainties before him. There
was a certain knot of persons who struck me as
being determined to monopolize the whole attention
of the King; and, upon the present occasion, two
awkward boys, one a son and the other a nephew
of the Great Unknown, assisted the laird of Braehead
in carrying the basin and ewer, but they
came and went unheeded. The tradition upon
which this service of the basin is founded, is worth
repeating.</p>

<p>All the Jameses who lived and died kings of
Scotland were fond of being their own spies; and
for this purpose, as well as for other purposes, they
were in the habit of travelling the country disguised
and alone; upon which occasions their doings
had more of love or of war in them, according
to the disposition of the royal incognito. The
rambles, and amours, and songs, of James V.
are well known, and so are some of the brawls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
battles of James II., not the second of England,
who fought by mercenaries for the purpose of
slavery, but the second of Scotland, who occasionally
fought in prize battles with his subjects,
by way of experiment as to whether the sinews of a
man or a monarch were the better knit.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion, a gang of gypsies assailed
him at Cramond, a few miles west of Edinburgh;
and, though he fought long and desperately, he
was beaten down. A ploughman, of the name of
Howison, who was threshing in a barn not far off,
heard the noise, ran toward the place, and seeing
one man assailed, down, and all but defeated, by
so many, began to belabour the gypsies with his
flail; and, having great strength and skill at his
weapon, soon put the gypsies to flight, lifted up
the King, carried him to his cottage, presented him
with a towel and water to remove the consequences
of the fray, and then, declaring that himself was
“master there,” set the stranger at the head of
his humble board. “If you will call at the castle
of Edinburgh,” said the stranger, “and ask for
Jamie Stuart, I will be glad to return your hospitality.”
“My hospitality,” said the farmer, “is
nae gryte things in itself; and it was gien without
ony thought o’ a return, just as nae doot you wad
hae done to me in the same tacking; but I am
obliged to you for your offer, and wad like to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
castle at ony rate. The King is a queer man, they
say, and has queer things about him.” The stranger
upon this took his departure; and the rustic was
well pleased with the idea that he would get a sight
of the inside of that strong and majestic pile, of
which he had so long admired the exterior.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards he repaired to the castle,
inquired for “ane Jamie Stuart, a stout gude-lookin
chield, that could lick a dozen o’ gypsies,
but not a score,” was admitted, and ushered into
an apartment, the splendour of whose furniture,
and the number of whose company, bewildered him
not a little. At last, however, he recognised his
old guest Jamie Stuart, went up to him, shook
him heartily by the hand, inquired how he did,
and expressed a very earnest wish to see the King,
if such an honour was at all possible for a man of
his condition. “The King is present now,” said
Jamie Stuart, “and if you look round, you will
easily know him, for all the rest are bareheaded.”
“Then, I’m thinkin’ it maun either be you or
me,” said Howison, pulling off his bonnet, which
till then his astonishment had prevented him from
thinking of; “and, as our acquaintance has begun
by my fighting for you, I had better keep to that
when you need it, and let you keep to bein’ King.”
“Then, as you are so true and so trusty,” replied
the monarch, “you shall ride home the laird of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Braehead.” “I like that better than twa kingdoms,”
said Howison, “but I canno’ accept o’ sae
much even frae your majesty, without gien’ something
for’t.” “Well, then,” said the King, “as
long as we are kings of Scotland and lairds of
Braehead, let you and your’s present to me and
mine, a basin and towel to wash our hands, whenever
we ask for it.”</p>

<p>This was the only occurrence which took place
to break the dull activity of the dinner. But when
the cup circulated, a ceremony was performed which
delighted the corporation-men of the Athens, and
made the other corporation-men all over Scotland
sad through sore disappointment. The chief magistrate
of Edinburgh, who had taken his dinner as
plain Mr. William Arbuthnot, took his drink as
Sir William Arbuthnot, Knight Baronet of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,&mdash;the
knighthood, as was alleged, having been, for
the want of a sword, inflicted by that much more
appropriate weapon, a large carving-knife, and the
baronetage having subsequently issued from the
patent office in the usual form, and for the usual
fee. All this having been done, the King retired,
and the corporation-men kept up the feast, though
not so long or so heartily but that all the rest finally
went to their homes <i>more sober than a judge</i>.</p>

<p>After the King had witnessed the devotedness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the Athenian authorities at the table, it was proper
that he should see the devotion of the people in the
church; and here again was one of those scenes
which struck me, and must have struck him, very
forcibly, as to the difference of a free people,
and fawning courtiers, corporation fools, and party
slaves.</p>

<p>Becoming preparations having been made, and
the King having been furnished with a perspective
sketch of the church, and a written programme of the
service, it was agreed that the Very Reverend David
Lamont, D.D., Moderator and Spiritual Head
upon Earth of the Kirk of Scotland, should preach
before him, in the name and stead of all his willing
and worshipping brethren, while the “men,” the
“leaders,” and the people, should demean themselves
with that decorum, which the day, the service,
and the occasion required.</p>

<p>When the services of the Scottish kirk are performed
in a becoming manner, there is a feeling,
a sublimity, and a heavenliness about them, of
which one who considers only their simple and
unadorned structure could form no adequate idea;
and when I observed the still and unbroken solemnity
of the service, and the effect which it
obviously had, not only upon those who are accustomed
to it, but upon those strangers who, in
whatever predilection they had for one religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
more than another, were wedded to the more artificial
and gaudy ritual of another church&mdash;a church
which had been at enmity with the Scottish kirk
from the beginning, and which, in dislike to the
system of sober equality among the Scottish clergy,
and the democratic nature of their church establishment,
have attempted to hold up their form of
worship as cold, meagre, incapable of stirring up
devotion in the hearts of men, and, by consequence,
not so gratifying to the Almighty as the more costly
and complicated ceremonial of others,&mdash;I could not
help believing that, of all forms of religion, the
simplest is decidedly the best, and that if the object
of the propagators of Christianity was nothing
but the cultivation of the minds and the improvement
of the morals of society, they would carefully
avoid all artifice and all show. Those, indeed,
who have considered the correspondence that exists
between the forms of religious worship, and the
intellectual culture of the great body of the people,
cannot have failed to observe, that pompous shows
and gaudy ceremonies have ever been the concomitants
of general ignorance and superstition, and
that a plain and unadorned system of worship, has
uniformly been characteristic of an intelligent
people.</p>

<p>Scotland is an eminent example of this; and
whoever takes the trouble to investigate the structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of Scottish society will, to a certainty, find
that for half their virtues, and more than half their
information, they are indebted to the presbyterian
kirk. Nor is it by any means difficult to find out
the reason: A religion of shows and of sounds,&mdash;of
mummeries and of music,&mdash;must ever be a religion
of the senses. How gaudy soever the trappings,
and how fine soever the music, they can
afford nothing more than a gratification of the
senses at the time. Forms cannot exist vividly but
in matter, and when the string of an instrument
ceases to vibrate on the ear, the pleasure which it
affords, however sweet or however delightful, is at
an end: they enter not into reflection; they stimulate
not the more rational and permanent faculties
of the mind; and, though they may be made to
influence, and influence powerfully, the passions,
while they last, they leave no lesson which can be
useful as a general rule of life. Hence, though the
churches of Scotland be, compared with those of
England, rude in the extreme; though the sacred
music of Scotland be often the untutored attempt
of nature, without the aid of flutes, hautboys, and
violins, as in the poorer churches of England, or
the solemn notes of the organ, as in the richer ones;
and though the prayers of the Scottish preacher
are generally couched in terms less stately and sublime
than those of the service-book of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
church, yet we have the clearest proof that can be
given of the superior efficacy of the Scottish mode
of worship, in the superior veneration which the
people of Scotland, without any hope or even possibility
of earthly reward from it, pay to the rites
and ordinances of religion, and especially to that
most beneficial of all religious institutions, the setting
apart of the sabbath as a day of calm tranquillity
and holy meditation.</p>

<p>I know not whether the Author of these pages,
or the Sovereign of these realms, was the more delighted
with the calm, sustained, and religious air
of the people of the Athens and of Scotland, as
they both proceeded from the palace of the Holyrood
to the High Kirk, on the morning of Sunday,
the 25th of August. A countless multitude
thronged the street, and filled the windows and
house-tops; they were habited in the neatest and
cleanest manner; and their profound silence formed
a wonderful contrast to the noise of their mirth
upon the former occasions. There was not a cheer,
a shout, or even a whisper; but, as the King
passed along, the men lifted their hats, and the
whole passed with the most sustained but respectful
reverence. They appeared to respect their King,
but to respect him less than they did the institutions
of their God, and the simple sublimity of that
religion which their own perseverance, faith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
courage, had gained them, in spite of the efforts
of courtiers and kings, by whom its integrity, and
even its existence, were menaced.</p>

<p>The extreme decorum of the people upon this
day was the more creditable, that it had been arranged
by none of the authorities; and those who
formed the mass of the spectators were chiefly such
as, on account of their distances or their pursuits,
could not obtain a sight of their monarch upon any
other day.</p>

<p>In the crowd I could distinguish a number, who,
from their substantial blue garments, their broad
bonnets, their lank uncut hair, their great staves,
and their shoes dirty, as from a long journey,
seemed to be true whigs of the covenant, who looked
upon the descendant of Brunswick as a chosen one
of Heaven’s appointment, whose ancestors had been
the means of preventing that civil and religious
slavery which had threatened them in 1715 and
1745.</p>

<p>As seemed to be the case with all parts of the
ceremony which were left to the awkward and
inexperienced official men of the Athens, the King’s
accommodation, or at least his attendance in church,
was by no means what it ought to have been. He
had brought a hundred pounds to give to the poor,
and he had some difficulty in getting it disposed of;
and, delighted with the unassisted vocal music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
which was really very good, he wished to join in
the psalm, but he was unacquainted with the book,
and there was nobody to point out the place for
him. Still, judging from appearance as well as
from all that I could hear afterwards, the King
was better pleased with the stillness and solemnity
of the Sunday than he had been with the shows of
the other days. One reason of this no doubt was,
that, on the Sunday, the King was not so belumbered
by the aspiring loyalists thrusting themselves
not only between him and the people, but between
him and his own ease, comfort, and pleasure, as
they had done in all those acts of the drama, of
which themselves formed a leading or conspicuous
part; and, as he had formerly expressed his high
approbation of the appearance, and, which sounded
more strange in the ears of a southern visitor, of
the cleanliness of the Scottish people, he had an
equal opportunity of complimenting them upon
their decorum.</p>

<p>After the King had paraded, and dined, and
heard sermon, there remained no further lion of
Athens to afflict him but the theatre; which was
arranged for his reception, as well as an Athenian
theatre could be expected to be arranged for such
a purpose, on the evening of Friday, the 27th of
August.</p>

<p>The people of the Athens never have been able,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and probably never will be able, to support a respectable
theatrical establishment. The genius of
the Scottish people generally is not theatrical.
There are still many sects of religionists among
them by whom the stage is denounced as a “tabernacle
of Satan.” This is by no means confined to
the provinces, or to the more austere or fanatical
classes of dissenters; for, at the time when “I, and
the King,” visited the Athens, her celebrated, and
most deservedly-celebrated preacher, of the presbyterian
establishment, was denouncing the sinfulness
of stage-plays, both from the pulpit and
the press; and though some of the courtly persons
whom fashion had induced to became churchwardens
or elders of his congregation, threatened to
rebuke or leave him, because, in the true spirit of
John Knox, he had preached a homily on kingly
duties, in which there was not much of flattery,
while the King was in the Athens, yet they let
him denounce the theatre as he pleased.</p>

<p>The more aspiring cast of the Athenians lay
claim to very superlative taste in theatrical matters,
as indeed they do in every thing; and hence, they
pretend that they do not patronise the theatre,
because they cannot find a company of players,
who come at all up to their standard of histrionic
perfection; and they appeal for proof to the fact,
that when any of the grand stars or comets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
London boards come to them for a night or two,
they throng the theatre with their persons, and
threaten to break it down with their plaudits. All
this, however, proves nothing, but that they are
unable to support a theatre, and that the crowding
to see a strange actor for a night or two arises not
from taste but from curiosity. The fact is, that,
though England has produced the very best dramatic
poet that ever lived, and some of the best
dramatic performers, yet that the drama, as a
matter of sentiment and feeling, and, as it were, of
constitutional necessity, does not tally with the
spirit even of the English people; and, as the
Scotch have all the business habits of the English,
together with a much greater degree of starchedness
of character, and incapability of purse, the
theatre cannot possibly flourish among them.</p>

<p>The London theatres, excepting in the case of
occasional and accidental runs upon a particular
piece, or a particular actor, are uniformly miserable
speculations for the proprietors; and it will be
found, that even the poor support which the theatres
in London get, is given them, not by the people
of London so much as by that vast concourse of
strangers who feel at a loss how to spend their
evenings. Before the people, either of the Athens,
or of any other part of the British dominions, can
become theatrical, they must have a little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
relaxation from hard labour than they can at
present command. The national debt, and the
immense public establishments, are the real causes
why there are not only no Shakspeares now, but
why the heroes of the old Shakspeare have given
place to the wooden or real horses of a more buffooning
race. The people must not only work, but
work hard, during the live-long day; and when
they have an hour which they can snatch from the
abridged civilities of social life, for the purpose of
looking at a theatrical exhibition, they very naturally
prefer that which costs them no labour of
thought, and which makes them laugh, to that
which would impose upon them fatigue of the
mind in addition to fatigue of the body. To say,
therefore, that the Athens does not support the
theatre, because she cannot find a <i>corps dramatique</i>
that comes up to her taste, has no surer a
foundation than any other of those airy structures
which she builds as the monuments of her glory.
None of the fine arts, as a matter of abstract study
and speculation, and apart from its contributing to
the general comforts of life, can ever prosper in such
a state of society as that of England at the present
day; and if they languish in the British metropolis,
where there is the greatest abundance both
of money and of idle people, what must they do
among a people who are comparatively so poor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
so plodding as those of the Athens? If a London
merchant, who goes to his place of business at one,
and leaves it at three, does not encourage the
drama, and the other fine arts; what can be expected
from an Athenian special pleader, who
drudges at Stair and Erskine, and thumbs Morison’s
Dictionary of Decisions, from grey dawn to
dark midnight, except during the hours that he is
occupied in gossiping in the large hall of the parliament-house,
or wrangling in the little courts,
and less niches? It is true, that Mr. Clark, now
Lord Eldin, could adorn his brief with drawings,
even in those places,&mdash;that the Unknown, who is
only a copying machine in his official capacity, can
spin a chapter, or correct a proof sheet,&mdash;and that
Jeffery has sometimes been caught writing an article
for the Edinburgh Review, during the time that
some long-winded proser was darkening the case on
the other side; but still all this is done more as
matter of business than of pleasure; and would, in
almost all cases, be let alone, were it not for the
fee that it produces.</p>

<p>Miserable, however, as is the support which the
theatre of the Athens receives, and must continue
to receive, the King was constrained to visit it;
however, from the smallness of the house and the
number of those who had legal admission as immediately
belonging to his retinue, or his household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
he could be for a long time gazed upon by the
chosen, without any great admixture of the mere
vulgar. The play was nothing; but there was
something rather novel in the by-acting. The
great chief of Glengarry, who has made himself
conspicuous in many ways and upon many occasions,
and who has proved his descent from Ronald,
the elder of the two Vikings, who came robbing
and remained royal in the Hebudæ, being thus, not
only “every inch a king,” as well as George the
Fourth, but a king of a much older and a more
legitimate dynasty, stood up for the royal prerogative
of wearing his bonnet, and keeping his seat,
while the band was playing, and the audience
shouting, “God save the King.” For this, he
was complained of somewhat angrily, and, in my
opinion, very unjustly; for, if they played and
sung “God save the King,” in honour of George
Augustus Frederick Guelph, King of Great Britain
and Hanover, then they stinted others of their
due, and showed a partiality not to be borne, when
they did not strike up “God save the Chief,” in
honour of Alexander Ronaldson Macdonell, of
Glengarry and Clanronald, heir to the titles, the
virtues, and the valour, of Donald of the Isles.
This was omitted, however, and so after this dramatic
scene, the Monarch of these realms staid not
another hour in the Athens; but merely rested a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
day in the neighbourhood, and then took his departure,
in manner as shall be set forth in another
section.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">THE NATIONAL MONUMENT.<br />
“<i>Si monumentum queriris, Circumspice.</i>”</p>

<p class="pn1">Though the laying of the foundation-stone of the
“National Monument of Scotland,” is to be regarded
as a mere interlude in the royal acting, and
of course as a mere parenthesis in my outline of
the same, yet it merits a few sentences, not only on
account of the curiosity of the thing itself, but
because it throws some light upon the vanity of
Scottish official men in general, and upon those of
the Athens in particular.</p>

<p>To some people, the idea of building a national
monument for Scotland, or in other words, a monument
for the Scottish nation, may seem a work
not of supererogation merely, but of folly; because
the Scottish nation, so far from running any
risk of becoming extinct and being forgotten, is in
a very lively and flourishing state; and there are
no people that, wherever they may go, cherish so
carefully and proclaim so loudly, the praise of their
country, as the Scotch. But this monument was
intended to answer two very nice purposes,&mdash;the
one for the glory of the loaf-and-fish politicians of
Scotland, and the other for that of the Athens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
So long as the country was in a state of distress,
and it was doubtful whether the politics of the old
or new system would ultimately triumph upon the
Continent of Europe, a very large proportion of
the leading men of Scotland, and of the Athens,
joined the people in being Whigs. As such, they
had no immediate share in the good things of the
state; but they hoped that the wheel of hostilities
would revolve, bring the party into office, and so
feed them in proportion to the extent of their fasting
and longing. Independently of their intrinsic
value, Whig politics are a much better theme for
declamation than Tory. In that faith, one can
talk long and largely about the majesty and rights
of the people, and when not in office, one can promise
as largely as one pleases; while the most judicious
plan for the Tory is to pocket his reward,
and thank God; or if he boasts any thing it must
be only to the choice few, and when the inspiration
of a dinner looses his tongue. Under all those circumstances,
the Tories of the Athens, though they
had all the substantial things their own way, were
confined to the actual enjoyers of office and emolument;
and the tongues and pens of their opponents
were so hard upon them that they had begun to be
afraid to hold even their wonted meetings. Thus
it became necessary that they should do something
which should either win the hearts or dazzle the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
eyes of their countrymen. The former was without
the compass of their speculations; so they set
about the latter; and after floundering a long time
from one scheme to another, they at last hit upon
this wise one of the monument.</p>

<p>After the requisite number of ladies and gentlemen
had licked the scheme into some sort of shape
in private, they held a meeting in the Assembly-Rooms
in George-Street, on the 24th of September,
1819, at which his Grace of Athol presided; and
divers other persons, equally loyal, and almost
equally tasteful and wise, gave their assistance.
The time was well-chosen. It was in the very
depth of those political clouds which, arising immediately
from the sufferings of the people, and remotely,
as was supposed, from the wasteful expenditure
and unaccommodating pride of the Administration,
were threatening to burst upon both
ends of the island. The object, as set forth in the
resolutions of that meeting, was threefold:&mdash;First,
the erection of a monument to commemorate the
great naval and military achievements of the British
arms, during the late glorious and eventful
war; secondly, in order to testify the gratitude of
the projectors to the Almighty, they were to connect
a church with the monument of the achievements,
and endow two ministers to officiate therein;
and thirdly, they were to set apart a certain number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of the seats in this church for the benefit of pious
strangers visiting the Athens. All which being
settled, they set about a subscription for raising the
funds. In those days, however, they were by no
means such adepts in political arithmetic as they
have since become, through the labours of Joseph
Hume and others; and though they had their
purses, they were neither so full nor so easily
opened as their loyal intentions. As that moment,
the monument to the achievements, the church,
and the two ministers, would have cost them more
than a hundred thousand pounds; and thus the
monument, besides its more avowed and desired
objects would have been the monument of all the
disposeable cash of the whole of the Tories of Scotland,&mdash;a
sepulture and a remembrance of which,
they were not altogether so fond. Wherefore,
finding that the subscriptions amongst themselves
were in danger of becoming the monument of the
project, they applied to the General Assembly of
the Scottish Kirk. That venerable constellation of
churchmen, after grave deliberation, declared that
the thing was “a most suitable and appropriate
expression of gratitude to the Lord of Hosts,” and
forthwith recommended a general address from the
one thousand and one parish pulpits of the Kirk,
for the purpose of obtaining collections and subscriptions
from the one thousand and one parishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
But the parsons were not over hearty in the cause,
and the people were less so; and thus the whole
sum produced did not much exceed a hundred
pounds&mdash;about two shillings for the prayers and
pleading of each minister.</p>

<p>Having thus learnt from experience, that the
scheme would not do, either as a party and political
measure among themselves, or as a clerico-politico-religious
one in the hands of the ministers
of the kirk, they took up new ground altogether,
and addressed themselves to a much more active
and promising principle, the vanity of the Athens.
They began with a long and learned parallel between
the overthrow of Bonaparte and that of
Darius and Xerxes; and then, coming gradually
a little nearer home, they hinted, that, in his encouragement
of the arts, Lord Melville was the
express image of Pericles. This brought them to
the marrow of the subject: Edinburgh was very
much like Athens,&mdash;it was, in fact, the Modern
Athens, or the Athens Restored; the Calton Hill
was a far finer thing than the Acropolis; the freestone
of Craigleith excelled in beauty and durability
the marble of Pentelicus; the Firth of Forth
outstretched and outshone the Egean or the Hellespont;
the kingdom of Fife beat beyond all comparison
Ionia and the Troad; Ida and Athos were
mere mole-hills compared with North Berwick Law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and the Lomonds; Platæa and Marathon had nothing
in them at all comparable with Pinkie and
Preston Pans; Sir George Mackenzie of Coull,
excelled both Æschylus and Aristophanes; Macvey
Napier was an Aristotle; Lord Hermand a Diogenes;
Macqueen of Braxfield had been a Draco;
the Lord President was a Solon; a Demosthenes
could be found any where; and Lord Macconachie
was even more than a Plato. Then, to make the
parallel perfect, and indeed to make the Modern
Athens every way outstrip the Athens of old, only
one thing was wanting, and that was, that there
should be erected upon the top of the Calton Hill,
a copy of the Temple of Minerva Parthenon, to be
called the national monument of Scotland, as that
had been called the national monument of Greece;
and that the independence of the modern city and
the modern land should survive the building of
the monument as long as that of the old had done.</p>

<p>The proposal took amazingly; for, in an instant,
every quill was up to the feather in ink,
every tongue was eloquent, and every lady and
gentleman took an Athenian <i>nom de guerre</i>&mdash;Alcibiades
there, Aspasia here, till they had
Athenized the whole city. Still, however, fine as
the situation was, and fond as they were of it, a
Parthenon in speech was a cheaper thing than a
Parthenon in stone; and so, though Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had, beyond all doubt or dispute, become the Modern
Athens, it still wanted the temple of Minerva
upon the Calton Hill as the national monument
of Scotland.</p>

<p>It was still wished and resolved, however, that
this finishing touch should be given to the likeness
and the glory of the Modern Athens; and, as the
tories, the ministers, and the dilettanti, had all
failed in the accomplishment of the thing, it was
resolved to call in royal aid; and have the assistance
of his majesty at laying the basis of this
mighty monument. But even here, there were obstacles
in the way of this slow-going Parthenon: it
would be too much to ask the King to lay the
foundation-stone in person; and yet, if he were
present, the laying of it would be a humiliation of
the whole tories of the country in the sight of
majesty; for it happened unfortunately for them,
that the grand master of the mystic craft in Scotland
was none other than the whig Duke of Hamilton:
But wisdom has many ways of going to
work; and so they resolved that the tory lords
should act the King by deputation, and command
the grand master to do the work. This was no
sooner thought of than put in execution. An immense
number of the craft formed a procession,
and the stone was laid, leaving the structure to be
built when time and funds should permit.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“To your tents, O Israel.”</p>

<p class="pn1">Never was the philosophic adage of “soonest
hot, soonest cold,” more completely verified, than
in the case of the loyal official men of Scotland.
At every point, and in every thing, they had been
eclipsed; in most things they had felt a fancied
neglect and disappointment; and never did Welsh
squire or Highland chief, when justled by the
London crowd in Cheapside or the Strand, sigh
more for his white villa or grey fortalice, than
they did for a return to the snug honours of their
respective burghs. There was wormwood in the
cup which they durst not throw away, and which
they were unwilling to drink,&mdash;there were from
each burgh, men whom they had formerly attempted
to look down upon, in consequence of an assumed
or presumed influence at court; and those men had
seen with what indifference themselves and their
very best addresses had been treated; and they
would not fail to communicate this to the people
at home. Where they had hoped to shine, they
had only smoked; where they had made sure of
rising, they had sunk; where they had counted
upon honours and rewards, they had only incurred
expense which their constituents would compel
them to pay out of their own pockets; and where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
they had sown hopes the most sweet, they could
reap nothing but disappointment the most bitter.
It was piteous to see their looks,&mdash;blank and dull
enough when they first came in the flush of their
importance; but now doubly blank, and trebly
dull.</p>

<p>“<i>Et tu Brute!</i>” The very magistrates of Edinburgh,&mdash;that
provost Arbuthnot, the moment that
he knew his own was to be the only “<i>gentry</i>” conferred
upon a Scottish magistrate, cut his country
cousins. Not even Glasgow herself, notwithstanding
her lodgings hired at a thousand guineas a
week, could be permitted to taste so much as a
glass of cold water in the presence of the King.
Perth “tried herself o’ the Gaelic,” and swore all
the oaths of the mountains; the little, side-fidgetting,
owl-faced provost of Inverness, who had come
“over the hills and far away” in a dog-cart, in order
that he might avoid the contamination of his bailies,
poked out his under-lip like the edge of a singed
pan-cake, and with his right hand gave a most
fierce and ominous scratching to his left elbow.
Aberdeen blasted the eyes of his own cats, and
vowed that he would “vote for Josaph Heem,
oat o’ pyure retrebeeshon.”</p>

<p>Never, indeed, was bold beginning brought to so
lame and impotent a conclusion; but it was a conclusion
which any person, except a Scotch burgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
magistrate, might have anticipated. Even the
Lord-Mayor of London is a commoner at Hampstead
or Brixton, and what, then, could an Inverness
or a Perth Bailie, or even a Glasgow Provost,
be in the modern Athens, and while the whole of
the official men there were bowing before the King,
in the hope of securing all the advantage to themselves?
If neglect be the portion of the man who
can afford to place upon the table at his election-dinner
as much turtle as would float a seventy-four,
and who sends over the world,</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">&mdash;&mdash;“Argosies with portly sail,<br />
Like signiors and rich burghers of the flood,”</p>

<p class="pn1">what could be expected of the man who retailed
pig-tail tobacco by the yard, or played the leach to
the breechless urchins of the mountains? “Nothing,”
will be the answer of any uninterested
spectator or hearer; but to put any corporation
man, more especially if he be Scotch, in possession
of this part of his utter insignificance without
his own burgh, or indeed, to any rational
purpose, within it, would be as hard and hopeless a
task as ever was undertaken by man.</p>

<p>Thus the chances are, that though these poor
innocents (and to have beheld their rueful looks on
their neglect and disappointment, would have created
bowels in a Turk, or made Burdett pity, if
not love, borough-mongers,) felt all the bitterness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of the infliction, they would profit nothing by the
wholesome hint of the lesson,&mdash;just as in a school,
the blockheads get all the whipping, and none of
the Latin.</p>

<p>Even as early as the levee day, those persons
had found that they were not in their proper element,
and the discovery had become more plain
and palpable every day. Their first and fondest
hopes were that each would be made a peer; then
they came down to baronets; next to simple knights;
and again each would have been pleased if the
King had given him a snuff-box,&mdash;or even, latterly,
a pinch of snuff. But all that the King gave was
an Irish giving&mdash;he gave himself no trouble about
them; and the whole court, or, as tails were the
fashion, the whole royal tail, from the Right
Honourable Robert Peel, Secretary of State for
the Home Department, to Sir Patrick Walker,
Knight, Usher (not, as some say, of the white
feather,) but of the White Rod, followed at the
hinder parts of its royal master. Even with regard
to the counties, there were few of the men in
office who met with much regard. A Scotch lord-lieutenant
has commonly a very capacious swallow
himself; thus whatever the minor officers happen
to pick up is only at second hand through him;
and upon the occasion alluded to, a few wary
wights who gave themselves airs haughty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
tyranic enough, while in their own localities, might
be seen twittering after the great man who made
them, just as Irish beggars twitter after a mail-coach.
But hope is like the sun, it ever rises the
soonest, and sets the latest, upon the most elevated
point; and so, ere the last and lingering ray had
gone down upon the pinnacle of royalty, the middle
men of Scotland and of the Athens were dark
as Erebus. Long before that feast of which they
were forbidden to eat, and that solitary honour to
Provost Arbuthnot which they were forbidden to
witness, the greater part of the “bodies” had
taken their knapsacks and their departure.</p>

<p>For a day or two previous, they who one little
week before had looked down not only upon great
merchants and little squires, but absolutely upon
the nobles of the land, might be found at the corners
and crossings of streets, begging a bow from
the poorest of their townsmen.</p>

<p>On the morning preceding the pilgrimage, I took
an early walk round the Calton-Hill; and I cannot
say that I ever met with a spectacle more ludicrously
pathetic than the chief magistrate of a royal
burgh, who sat in brown and stony meditation
there. A large stone formed his seat; and, but
for his resemblance to human nature, and the chain
of office that was about his neck, I might have
supposed that the seat and the sitter were of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
same senseless material. The north-east wind swept
coldly upon him, but he appeared to heed it not;
as little did he notice me, as I went close up to scan
his singular appearance. In shape, in size, and in
colour, his face more resembled a brick than any
other similitude that I could find. One hand hung
upon his knee and held a snuff-box, by the inscription
upon which I could perceive that he had been
a colonel of volunteers; while the other hand, arrested
in middle course, as it bore its load from the
silver to the brazen repository, was relaxed in its
hold, and dropping upon the cravat that with
which he meant to powder the intellect. His speculationless
eye was directed across the blue Firth,
and to the brown mountains, among which I should
presume he had his residence; and, heedless of
any passer by, he was taking up his Ecclesiastes
like another Solomon: “Deil’s i’ that King! could
not he hae staid at hame, and let us continue to tell
him a’ abaut the countrie? We hae put ourselves
to nae sma’ fash an’ expense, and it has a’ come to
a bonnie upshot. Our business negleckit, half the
siller cuinzied out a’ our ain pooches, naething but
lookit doon upon here; an’ a’ for the sake o’ bein’
taunted and worried by the folk at hame, for sax
months at the least.” Thus saying, he bounced
up, buttoned his coat, trotted away to the coach-office,
and, instead of returning at the tails of four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
greys as he had come, was fain to ride outside the
stage-coach, and smuggle himself into his burgh
under cloud of night.</p>

<p>The rout soon became general: Glasgow, in
great wrath, took her coach, and her lamentation,
and drove so furiously, that the cries of “make
way for the duke,” and “stop thief!” resounded
alternately at the hamlets and turnpike-gates;
while the echo of the western city, emptied as it
still was of a great part of its inhabitants, was the
most dismal that can be imagined. Aberdeen tarried
not the wheels of her chariot, until she had
reached her own Castle Street; where the answer
that she made to the many inquiries as to what
she had gotten was, “It wad nae mak ony body
vera fat.” Nor was disappointment the only misery
against which they had to bear up. Perth got her
head broken by thrusting herself in the way at the
peer’s ball. Poor Dundee got her pocket picked
at some place she did not mention. Inverness was
put on quarantine when she went home. Inverbernie
found that during her absence, a radical
barber and breeches-maker had established himself
next door, and monopolized the whole custom;
and, in short, every one had a tale of woe, which,
while it pleaded for pity, found only derision.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the exhibition, a number
even of the people seemed to get heartily tired of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the business; and notwithstanding all the scramble
that was made by those whose interest it was to
preserve appearances as much as possible, every
succeeding act fell off in interest, and, had George
the Fourth remained in the Athens for but one
brief month, it is probable that the people of Scotland
would have returned to their own homes, and
the Athenians to the worship of their own idols.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">THE PARTING.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“Adieu, Adieu, Adieu! remember me.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shakspeare.</span>”</p>

<p class="pn1">The streets of the Athens, which had been
thinning of people ever since the King’s arrival,
were, on the morning of Friday the 30th of August,
the day on which he was to take his departure,
as still and silent as though the chariot-wheel
of majesty had never been heard in them. The
constables, lacqueys, and laced porters at the gates
of the Holyrood had dwindled to a small and feeble
remnant; no merry archer, in broad bonnet of
blue, and doublet of green tartan, demanded the
pass-word, with bent bow and pheon ready for the
string; the foot of the casual house-maid wakened
the old and melancholy echo in its deserted halls;
and those apartments which were so recently gladdened
by the gorgeous train of the King, and
made lovely and gay by the presence of all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Scotland could boast of the fair and the noble,
were in sure progress to being as usual “furr’d
round with mouldy damp and ropy slime,” over
which the faint recollection (for even then it was
waxing faint,) that the King had been there, “let
fall a supernumerary horror,” which, to those who
during the King’s stay had been raised to office,
and put on the guise of courtiers, only served to
make the night of his absence “more irksome.” The
cannon, which, for the previous fourteen days, had
ever and anon been pealing royal salutes, began to
be dragged from the heights of Salisbury Crags
and the Calton Hill; and the royal standard was
taken down, leaving the bare widowed staff bleaching
in the air. The guns of the venerable castle
too, had subsided into the common office of chronicling
the several holidays and anniversaries, as
though they had been a mere kalendar; the last
booths and benches were in the act of being pulled
down; and, excepting in shop-keepers’ books, in
the blackening of a few houses in the illumination,
and in the baronet’s patent of Sir William Arbuthnot,
and the knighthood of Raeburn, a painter,
and Fergusson, deputy-king of the Athenian beefeaters,
the Athens retained no external trace of the
royal visit, even when the royal cavalcade was
barely escaping from the suburbs.</p>

<p>The people were intoxicated with its coming, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
seemed for a time to have dreamed; but the dream
had melted away, and the interest seemed to be
measured exactly by the time that the King had to
remain. Every day it waxed less and less, till, on
the day of his departure, it had vanished altogether.
I say this, of course, of the people generally,&mdash;of
those who, in their minds and their circumstances,
are independent, and not of them who basked in
the sunshine of the court, or had realities or hopes
from the royal munificence. These, of course, followed
after the King to the last, and conveyed him
to his barge, but the people stood by with the
most provoking indifference, and, to the broadest
hints that they should shout, returned only a few
scattered murmurs of approbation. They turned
to each other, and talked of the passing splendour
as if it had been a common spectacle. At the same
time, the King himself, and not the mere pomp,
was certainly the object of their attention and solicitude.
“Hech,” said the old bonneted sire to
his neighbour, as the King passed them rapidly on
the beautiful lawn at Hopetoun House, “Hech!
an’ so that’s the real descendant o’ Brunswick, wha
preserved us the Declaration of Rights, and the
Protestant Succession, whilk allow ilka man, gentle
and simple, to hae the keepin’ o’ his ain body, and,
what’s muckle better, o’ his ain saul and conscience.
God bless him, an’ keep him frae evil counsellors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and sinfu’ neebours, for they say that the gryte
fouk about Lunnon are no’ just what they should
be.” Thus did the rustics hold converse with one
another; and it could not be expected that persons
who had their minds in tone for such remarks,
could bawl and shout like the unreflecting rabble,
whose tongues, were it King George or King
Crispin, would be equally loud.</p>

<p>That the loyalty of official men, of all conditions,
in Scotland, is as fawning and obsequious, as in
any country under the sun, I could not fail to observe:
as little could I fail to observe, that that of
the people of Scotland is of a very different character,
and not to be judged of by their shouting
or not shouting at a royal pageant. With them,
loyalty is, like every thing else, a matter of reason
and reflection, and not of mere impulse and passion;
and they never lose sight of the original and
necessary connexion between the King and the
people. They do not look upon the King as one
who is elevated above man and mortal law, and
who holds a character directly from Heaven, in
virtue of which, he can, at his pleasure, and without
being accountable, put his foot upon the neck
of millions of the human race. They consider him
as originally set up by common consent, and for
the common good, and they admit of the law of
lineage and succession just because it saves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
chance of civil war, and gives a centre and a rallying
point to the strength and energy of the country.</p>

<p>The melancholy, which the now deserted state of
the Athens, contrasted with its recent bustle and
activity, was calculated to produce, was increased
by the day of the King’s departure being one of the
most gloomy and comfortless that it is possible to
imagine. The wind alternately swept in hurricanes
which drove immense masses of clouds over the
city, and died away in dead calms which allowed
those clouds to retain their positions and pour out
their contents in torrents. Early as was the season,
the leaves from the few trees in the vicinity of the
Athens had begun to fall; and, as the wind freshened,
they coursed each other along the dirty and
deserted streets in ironical mimickry of those processions
by which they had so lately been filled.
It was no day either for examining the still life of
the Athens, or for studying the manners of the
Athenians; and so, as my chief purpose had been
delayed by every display during the King’s visit,
I thought it just as well to see the end,&mdash;to mark
the difference of feeling and expression that the
people would have at the time of a King’s coming
and at that of his going. Accordingly, I set out
for Hopetoun House, where royalty was to be refreshed,
ere he again attempted the waters.</p>

<p>It had been expected, that the King would grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
with his royal presence, Dalmeny Castle, the beautiful
seat of Lord Roseberry, but he contented
himself with a drive through the grounds. Nor
was the day such as to permit him to see the prospect
in descending Roseberry Hill to Queensferry.
The view there is peculiarly fine, and to Scotchmen
it must be highly interesting. Immediately below
is the Forth, spotted with islands and covered with
shipping. To the left are the rich woods and extensive
demesnes of Hopetown, with the ancient
burgh of Queensferry at their entrance. To the
right, are the bolder shores of Fife, over which
rises the beautiful ridge of Ochills. The towers
of Stirling, long the seat of kings, rise in the
centre; and at no great distance is the field of
Bannockburn; and to the right, amid the grey
pinnacles of Dunfermline, sleep the ashes of the
Bruce. Further off Benledi, Ben-an, and Ben-voirlich
raise their lofty crests, and the noble peak
of Ben-lomond pierces the most distant cloud.
Altogether it is a scene worthy of royal attention,
and within its ample circuit are countless recollections
not unworthy of kingly meditation. The
place where Græme’s Dyke set bounds to the ambition
of the Romans, till the Caledonians fell a
prey to luxury and corruption, may tell that the
strength of a people is not in walls and ramparts,
but in courage, in virtue, and in freedom. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
stone near the banks of Carron, where the royal
standard of Scotland first was displayed triumphant
after years of suffering and humiliation, and the
spot at which the battle-axe of Bruce cleft the
helm and head of the invader’s champion, tell what
may be done by an independent people, under the
conduct of a brave and virtuous prince; the veneration
with which Scotchmen yet look towards the
crumbling ruins of Dunfermline, proclaims that
the patriotism of a King far outlives mere pomp
and tinsel; and the fields of Falkirk and Sherriff-muir,
might have whispered in the ear of George
the Fourth, how hard Scotchmen had struggled in
order that his family might wear the crown. It
seemed, however, that Nature had refused his
majesty a glance of the talismans of these recollections;
and that, as he had confined his attentions
(we mean his private attentions, which, of course,
are exclusively at his own disposal,&mdash;in his public
displays he was equally attentive to all,) to one
family or party, so the glories of Scotland were
shrouded from his view. During the whole day,
a thick cloud lowered over the western horizon,
through which only the nearest summit of the
Ochills was but dimly seen. When his majesty
came to Queensferry, it seemed as if “Birnam
Wood had come to Dunsinane,” for the whole
fronts of the houses, with their appendages, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
covered with boughs; boughs too were hung across
the street, and showed like triumphal arches turned
topsey-turvey, as in sorrow at the departure of the
King. A small platform was erected at Port Edgar,
a place a little to the west of Queensferry,
about which there is some idle tradition of an
ideal kingly visit, and deliverance from shipwreck.
Thence to Hopetoun House, a distance of about
two miles, a road was now made along the margin
of the Forth. In the halls of the gallant Earl,
a <i>dejeunér à la fourchette</i> was prepared for the
King, a select few of the nobility, and many of the
neighbouring gentry. The country people had assembled
on the lawn, to the amount of some thousands,
and were regaled with two or three butts of
October.</p>

<p>The King arrived at the place of embarkation
about three o’clock, walked to the platform, leaning
on Lord Hopetoun’s arm, and was received on the
platform by the venerable chief commissioner,
Adam, as convener of the Queensferry trustees.
He took his old friend cordially by both hands,
and was by him conveyed to the royal barge,
which he entered, and reached the yacht in about
six minutes. Although the King’s “last speech”
had been hawked through the streets of the Athens
in the morning, there is no evidence that he made
one; and, indeed, gradually to its close, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
matter had melted away, like a dream from the recollection
of the half-awakened. Scarcely, too, had
his majesty got on board the yacht, when the dark
clouds veiled his whole squadron like a curtain,
and the incessent pelting of the rain scattered the
remnant of the people.</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty, and at a late hour,
that I was able to return to the Athens; and when
I arose on the following morning, and sallied out
to begin my survey, the contrast was too strong for
my feelings. The whole line of George Street was
unbroken, except by the hoary form of a beggar
crawling along in front of those assembly-rooms
which had lately been so gay; and the trim and
active figure of the editor of the Edinburgh Review,
who, with a great bundle of law-papers under
one arm, and a new book under the other,
shot along with as much rapidity, as though the
most strong and skilful of the archer-band had
discharged him from his bow. Queen Street was
desolate; and in King Street, the only thing that I
could notice was one or two of the personages who
had lately flaunted their tails as highland chiefs,
taking leave of their law-agents, with downcast
and sorrowful looks. The regalia of Scotland were
again consigned to their dull and greasy apartment
in the castle; the High Street, which so recently
had rung with the acclamations of serried multitudes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
now echoed to the grating croak of the
itinerant crockery-merchant, and the ear-piercing
screams of the Newhaven fish-wife. The gewgaws,
which for the last two weeks had glittered
in the windows of the shop-keepers, had again
given place to sober bombazines and webs of
duffle; and the shop-keepers themselves were either
leaning against the posts of their doors, and yawning
to an extent which would have thrown any but
Athenian jaws off the hinges, or sitting perked
upon three-footed stools within, casting looks, in
which hope formed no substantial ingredient, upon
the long pages which their country friends had
enabled them to write in their day-books; and of
which, to judge from appearances, it was pretty
plain that the term of payment would be to the full
as long as the amount. Every where, in short,
that I came, there was an air of desolation; not by
any means that the Athens was mourning for the
departure of the King, for among the few persons
who were visible, his name was not so much as
mentioned, but in her own appearance she was
mournful indeed, and though she retained the
same form as during the display and rejoicing, her
spirit seemed to be clean gone; and it was quite
evident that, in order to catch the average and peculiar
likeness of this boasted city, I must tarry
till the present appearance had passed off, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
remove to a distance, till the natural one should
return.</p>

<p>I preferred the latter alternative, and resolved,
after resting for that day, to forget both the glory
and the gloom in a month or two among the Scottish
mountains; and then return to the Athens,
when the return of business, of people, and of
prate, should have been brought back to their
ordinary channels.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pc2 lmid">THE ATHENS AND THE ATHENIANS IN
GENERAL.</p>

<hr class="d5" />

<p class="pc reduct">“A city set on an hill, which cannot be hid.”</p>

<hr class="d6" />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">In</span> point of diversity of situation and beauty, and
durability of building materials, few cities have
the same advantages as the Athens; and I know
of no city, of which the general and distant effect,
upon what side soever one approaches it, is more
picturesque and striking. But, as is the case with
most things that look well as wholes, one is miserably
disappointed when one comes to examine the
details. The ground upon which the Athens is
built bears some resemblance to a fort with a ditch
and glacis. The Castle and High Street, with the
clustered buildings on each side, compose the fort;
the Cow-gate on the south, the Grass Market on
the west, and the North Loch on the north, form
the ditch, which bears some resemblance to a
noose thrown round the Castle, and having the
ends stretching away eastward by the Holyrood;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and beyond this ditch the glacis slopes toward
St. Leonard’s, the Loch of Duddingstone, and the
Meadows on the south, and toward the water of
Leith on the north. The central division, although
its situation be very airy, and also very favourable
for cleanliness, has nothing to boast of in either of
these respects. The houses are so closely huddled
together, that, excepting the High Street itself,
which is rather spacious, the inhabitants may almost
shake hands from the windows of the opposite
houses; and they are built to such a height, that
scarcely a glimpse of sunshine can find its way
within two storeys of the foundations. In all this
part of the Athens, there seems to be the greatest
dislike to subways and common sewers; and thus,
unless when the High Street is washed by a torrent
of rain, it is by no means the most pleasant to
perambulate. The southern ditch, or Cow-gate, is,
throughout its whole extent, as filthy and squalid
as can well be imagined; and, with the exception
of a few public buildings, and one or two little
squares, there is not much to be commended on
the glacis beyond. Indeed the whole, southward
of the North Loch, which the Athenians style the
sublime part of their city, is more remarkable for
the sublimation of mephitic effluvia than of any
other thing. The new town again, or the portion
between the North Loch and the water of Leith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
is as dull as the other is dirty. The principal
streets consist of long lines of stone building, without
any break or ornament except wicket-doors
and trap-hole windows, which render the whole
very heavy, and induce one to believe that they
are constructed with the intention of being as inaccessible
and dark as possible. Princes Street,
which is a single row, looking across the tasteless
and unadorned gulf of the North Loch toward
the beetling and shapeless masses of the old town,
had originally been intended for private dwelling-houses,
at the rate of a whole family per floor.
Circumstances have changed, however. The Athenian
fashionables (contrary to the natural tendency
of the Scotch) have moved northwards;
their places have been supplied by drapers from
the Lawn Market, barbers from the Parliament
Stairs, and booksellers from the Cross; and, as the
immense weight of tall stone-houses renders the
alteration of the ground-floor dangerous, without
taking down and rebuilding the whole, the expense
of which would be very great, Princes Street is
perhaps the most tasteless and clumsy line of shops
in the island of Great Britain; while, so anxious
are the people to huddle upon the top of each
other, that it is not uncommon to find four or
five shops for very opposite kinds of wares, in a
pile up and down the same stair-case. George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Street is the most gloomy and melancholy that can
well be imagined; and a walk along its deserted
pavements is sufficient to give any one the blue
devils for a week. Queen Street is longer, but
not a whit more lively; and, though the view from
it be both extensive and varied, it seems no great
favourite with the Athenians. Farther to the
north the buildings are newer, and there is occasionally
an attempt at the recurrence of architectural
ornaments at the end of certain lengths of the
buildings; but these ornaments want taste in their
form, and force in their projections, and thus increase
the poverty of the effect. Throughout the
whole private dwellings of the Athens, you are
impressed with the cold eternity of stone and lime,
and you look in vain for that airy elegance, that
rich variety of taste, and that repose of comfort,
which you find in other places. Villas, self-contained
houses, and snug or even decent gardens,
seem to be held in the greatest abhorrence. You
meet not with one of the delightful little boxes
which are scattered round London by thousands,
and of which there are always a few in the vicinity
of even third-rate towns in England. The ambition
of the Athenians appears to be, to make every
four stone walls a joint stock company, as dull, as
tasteless, and as heavy, as a stack of warehouses
in Thames Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the objects of Athenian detestation, the
greatest, however, seem to be decently laid out
pleasure-grounds, and trees. Strangers used to
say that the rustic Scotch cut down all sorts of
bushes, because ghosts and spirits whistled in them
on windy nights; and really, when I looked at the
many fine situations in and about the Athens,
which the Athenians have taken particular care
neither to improve nor to plant, I could not help
thinking that this superstition, now banished from
every province in Scotland, has taken up its abode
in the Scottish metropolis. True, they have a
public walk round the Calton-Hill, but that is
merely a thing of yesterday; and though they have
placed upon the top of it a monument to Lord
Nelson, modelled exactly after a Dutch skipper’s
spy-glass, or a butter churn; an astronomical observatory,
tasteful enough in its design, but not
much bigger than a decent rat-trap, or a twelfth-cake
at the Mansion-House; and are to build “the
National Monument;” yet they have never thought
of planting so much as a thistle, but have left the
summit of the hill in all its native bleakness, and
allowed it to be so much infested by lazy black-guards
and bare-footed washerwomen, as to be unsafe
for respectable females even at noon-day;&mdash;while
after dusk this, the most fashionable promenade
of the Athens, is habitually the scene of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
much and so wanton vice, that instead of an ornament
to the city, as it might easily be made, it is a
nuisance and a disgrace.</p>

<p>The royal precinct of the Holyrood, which occupies
a piece of rich level ground about the
palace, and which stretches a considerable way up
the romantic heights to the south, is, one would
think, a chosen place for taste to display itself upon;
and when there are taken into the account the
boast of the Athenians that their Holyrood is the
finest royal palace in Britain, and that other boast
which is so habitual with them that there is no
need of repeating it, one would imagine that among
all their boasted improvements the royal precinct
would not have been overlooked; but all that they
appear to have done for it has been to make it as
dirty and as desolate as ever they could. The whole
filth of the old town (and that is no small commodity)
is collected in cesspools within a few yards of
the palace; and lest that should not be grateful
enough to the Athenian olfactories, a considerable
portion of the adjoining ground is set apart for the
collection of manure from all places. Upon the
other parts of the royal domain, about half a dozen
of scraggy and withered trees, and an old thorn-hedge,
more than half of which was when I viewed
it reposing in the lap of its neighbour ditch, are
the only attempts at landscape-gardening; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
grand-children of those by whom they were planted
must, by this time, be in their graves or their
dotage.</p>

<p>Salisbury Crags, again, are a natural object
which the people of a less classical city would not
only adore, but adorn by every means in their
power. The Athenians act differently; their rulers
hew down the picturesque masses of basalt, sell
them at so much a cart-load, for paving the streets
and Mac-Adamizing the highways, and put the
proceeds into that bottomless box called the “common
gude.” About midway up that bold front of
these cliffs which looks towards the city, there is
what may be termed an accidental public walk. It
has been formed by the cutting away of the rock
above for the purposes of gain, and the tumbling
down of the smaller fragments which were not
saleable. When the Athenian authorities were
alarmed at the Radicals, and bestirred themselves
in getting a general subscription for the relief of
those whom the changes consequent upon the late
war had thrown out of employment, a few labourers
were set to work on the middle of this
walk; but they had no plan and no superintendant,
and the funds were exhausted before it could
be made accessible at either end; while the whole
face of the Crags, instead of being tufted with
brushwood and festooned with creeping plants, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
might have been done at very little expense, is as
naked as&mdash;the shame of those who let it remain in
its present condition.</p>

<p>The meadows southward of the city, and the
adjoining common called “Bruntsfield-links,” are
not in much better condition. At some period,
indeed, a walk or two had been formed in the meadows,
and some hedges and trees planted, but
neither the one nor the other have been attended to;
while the grass is in so marshy a state that the
cows, to which it is almost exclusively assigned, can
with difficulty make their way across it. The
whole extent of the North Loch, too, was till very
lately, and great part of it is still, a putrid and
pestilent marsh, at once offensive to the eye, and
injurious to the health; and indeed, throughout
the whole compass of the Athens, there is scarcely
a tree or any thing green, except grass in the melancholy
streets towards the meadows, and moss
upon the dank walls of several of the more low and
squalid dwelling-houses.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, there are few places
that boast more of their improvements than the
Athens; and not many in which the people have
been made to pay more upon that score. But
either there has been a total want of skill in the
projectors, or a total want of economy in those
who had the execution,&mdash;if indeed there has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
been both. I was told repeatedly, that every
scheme and measure to which the Athenian authorities
give the name of a public improvement, is
uniformly a job for the benefit, not of the public,
but of some party or individual; and really, comparing
what is said to have been expended with
what has actually been done, I can find no other
theory that will sufficiently explain the facts. The
bell-rope of the Tron-Kirk appears not to have
been the only case in which a hundred pounds’ expense
has been incurred for the purpose of saving
a shilling.</p>

<p>Even in her public buildings, the Athens has
little of which she can boast. All the places of
worship belonging to the established Kirk are tasteless;
and the most modern ones are the most so.
St. Giles’ Cathedral is a black, shapeless, and
ruinous mass, stuck round with booths and police-officers;
and when one has said, that the portion of
it set apart for public worship as the High Kirk,
has a handsome old roof spoiled by tasteless painting,
and a square tower with an imperial crown,
which looks well at a distance, and not absolutely
ill when one is close to it,&mdash;one has about summed
up the whole of its merits. Respecting most of
the other Presbyterian churches, the less that is
said the better; the Grey-Friars, situate south of
the Castle, has an interest with the more devout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
people of Scotland, from the tombs of the martyrs
that are in the adjoining burial-ground; and St.
George’s Church, which terminates the street of
the same name, westward, is perhaps the most expensive
and unseemly abortion of modern architecture.
Public monuments in the Athens there are
none, except Nelson’s (formerly mentioned) on the
Calton-Hill, and Lord Melville’s column in St.
Andrew’s Square; and it is not the fashion of the
Athens to consider her burying-grounds as sacred,
or to set up memorials for the illustrious dead. If
her plan gives her as much trouble as this would
do, it is trouble of a different kind: she keeps
down, as much as she can, all those who are not
either illustrious already, or have not something to
confer, as long as they are alive; and when they
are dead, she gives herself no more trouble about
them.</p>

<p>Of her other public buildings, the College is the
largest; but as the plan was far beyond her means,
it stood a ruin for a very considerable period, and
will ultimately be a piece of patchwork in consequence
of a deviation from the original design. Still,
however, if it could be seen, the entrance front is
majestic; and the opposite square (especially the
whole façade in which the Museum is, and the
rooms for the Museum itself) is singularly chaste
and beautiful. The Register-House is a neat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
building, and seen to considerable advantage; but
there is something trifling in the whole air of it.</p>

<p>That frost-work style of architecture, which out-Goths
all the Goths that ever existed, has visited
the Athens, in some of its most tawdry and fantastic
specimens,&mdash;the chief of which are an episcopal
chapel near the west end of Princes’ Street,
and another near the east end of Queen Street, of
which it would puzzle a conjuror to point out the
most ridiculous.</p>

<p>Even the Castle has suffered the infliction of the
modern Athenian taste, by the erection of two or
three piles within its ramparts which have every
appearance of being cotton manufactories. So
much for the still life of the modern Athens.</p>

<p>To give a general idea of the Athenian people,
is by no means so easy a matter. They take their
character from a number of circumstances; and
the circumstances cannot be properly explained
without an allusion to the character, nor the character
rightly appreciated without a reference to
the circumstances. If one dwell upon the general
subject, one is forced to assert without any means
of proving; and if one take up a single particular,
although the proof be perfect in as far as that is
concerned, it is difficult to establish the connexion,
and point out the effect, with regard to the whole.
To examine society with a view to determine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
general spirit and character of those who compose
it, is like examining an animal with a view to a
knowledge of the nature and operation of the living
principle. If we examine it while alive and in the
performance of its functions, we see the results
without being able to understand the machinery;
and if we dissect and separate the different parts,
we have the machinery without the results; nor
does it appear that there are any means by which
we can obtain a contemporaneous view of both.</p>

<p>Thus, I found the character of the Athenians
different from that of the inhabitants of any other
city; and I also found many of the circumstances
under which they are placed to be peculiar; but
still I am not prepared to say, that the one set of
peculiarities are altogether to be set down as causes,
and the other as effects. The Athens has, doubtless,
stamped upon her people much of their character,
and they have requited her by service of
the same kind; so that any pretension to be profoundly
philosophic in the matter would be as impossible
as for my purpose it is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The leading characteristic of the Athenians, of
all ranks, all degrees of understanding, all measures
of taste, all shades of party, and both sexes, is to
esteem their own idols in preference to the idols of
every other people on the face of the earth. Their
own situation is the finest that can possibly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
found; and their own mode of improving it is superior
to any that could be suggested. Their men,
taken on the average, excel all others in wisdom,
and nothing can any way compare with the brilliance
of their women. In their manners they are never
vulgar; and in their tastes and judgments they do
not make half the slips and blunders which are
made by the rest of the world. The songs of
their poets (when they happen to have any) are
transcendent for sublimity and sweetness; and
the theories of their philosophers (of which they
are never without a reasonable portion) are ever
the most agreeable to nature, and the most nicely
put together. Upon the latter point they are
somewhat amusing; for in no place whatever have
philosophic theories been so often changed, as
among the sages of the succession of schools which,
shining from the Athens, have dazzled and illuminated
mankind; and yet, while each of these
theories has been the object of Athenian adoration,
it, and none but it, has been the true one.
In politics they have not, at least for a long time,
been agreed in their doctrines, or unanimous in
their worship; for in politics, interest has generally
much more to do than principle; and, being by
much the stronger of the two, and pulling opposite
ways with different parties, it has produced among
the Athenians, divisions which are as remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
as their union of self-adoration in most other
things.</p>

<p>Whence, it may be asked, does this self-adoration
arise? To which I would answer, in the true
Athenian manner, by asking where the affections of
a widowed and childless woman, who has no hope
and no chance of being courted by another, are
centred. The Athens is a widowed metropolis:
she stands registered in the pages of history as
having been the seat of kings,&mdash;she has her walls
of a palace, her name of a royal household, and
her gewgaws of a crown and sceptre; but the satisfying,
the fattening, the satiating,&mdash;or perhaps, as
some would call it, the stultifying presence and influence
of the monarch is not there; neither is
there any vice-roy, or other kingly vice-gerent set
high enough in its stead, to attract the attention,
and invite or command the worship of the people.
Thus, she is in herself not only the capital of
Scotland, but all that Scotland has localized as an
apology for a king; and therefore, besides assuming
the consequence due to a royal seat, she puts on the
airs of royalty itself, and worships her own shadow
in the mirror of the passing time. She is the only
city in the British islands which is so situated; and
this alone would be sufficient to give her a peculiarity
of character, and to make that peculiarity an
inordinate pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the Athens, taking her nominal and her
real situation into the account, is both metropolitan
and provincial: with regard to Scotland, she has
the name, and assumes the pride, of being metropolitan
in every thing; and in as far as concerns
the administration of the laws as peculiar to Scotland,
and in some degree, also, as concerning the
internal discipline of the Scottish Kirk, she is
really metropolitan; but in respect of Britain generally,
she is nothing more than a provincial city,
and the matters in which she is provincial have, to
the full, as powerful an influence upon her rival
character, as those in which she is, or flatters herself
to be, metropolitan, have upon the character
which she is anxious to assume. It is not, for instance,
in the nature of things, that she can ever
take the lead in matters of taste and fashion.
Wherever the executive and legislative powers of
the state are allocated, it is there that the gay and
the rich will throng; and notwithstanding all the
boasted elegance and taste of the Athens, no Scottish
nobleman, or even squire, spends his winter
there, if he can afford to spend it in London.
Hence, the Athens is not only destitute of the
source whence fashion flows, but she is also left
without the means by which it could be supported:
she is second-rate in her very nature, and also in
those who form her leading society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>But it follows of necessary consequence, that a
place which is second-rate in fashion and in wealth,
must be second-rate also in every thing which
fashion can encourage and wealth reward. A solitary
student who prosecutes a science, or a solitary
artist who practises an art, for its own sake, and
with an inferior degree of regard to present honour
and emolument, might perchance succeed better in
the Athens than in the British metropolis. But, as
British society is at present constituted, there are
few who have the means, and apparently not many
who have the desire, of proceeding in this way;
and therefore, the place which attracts the fashion
and the wealth, will also attract the superior talent,
in consequence of the superior means of rewarding
which it possesses; and upon this principle, it
would be just as vain for the Athens to hope to
rival London in any of the liberal arts, or elegant
amusements, as it would be for the Scotch lords of
Session, to rival the upper House of the British
Parliament, the George Street Assembly Rooms
to rival Almack’s, or the speeches of the Scotch advocates
to be read with as much attention as those
of the leading orators in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Of those classes of persons whose professions fix
them in Scotland, the Athens, if she manages her
patronage honestly and judiciously, may always
command the best. The judges and pleaders in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
her supreme court ought to be superior to the
sheriffs and attornies in the Scottish counties; her
clergymen, if those who have the appointment of
them were to be guided solely by merit, ought to
be the most learned and most eloquent that Scotland
can produce; the professors in her university
ought (under the same proviso) to be superior to
those of Aberdeen and St. Andrews, and perhaps
also to those of Glasgow; and, even in other cases,
she may produce one or two lights more brilliant
than the average in the metropolis;&mdash;but, in all
cases, where there is no necessary tie, real or imaginary,
to bind a man northward of the Tweed,
the Athens must be satisfied with making her selection
after London has been supplied. Or if she
deny the conclusion, she must also deny a principle
upon which her people know as well how to
act as the people of any place,&mdash;that whoever can
afford to pay the best, will get the best and the
readiest service.</p>

<p>For adopting this theory, the Athens must not
accuse me, either of ignorance of her erudition, or
of a wish to detract from her real merits. I know
her more intimately than she may perhaps be aware;
and if I were to judge her by the strict letter of my
own experience, I should place her sundry degrees
lower still; and tell the world of some of the bitterness
which she foolishly squeezes into her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
dish, and some of the ludicrous positions into which
she works herself, by attempting a grace and a
dignity, which her nature and her education alike
deny to her; but I have no desire to state any
more than is sufficient to establish the truth; and
if she can point out a theory either of this leading
feature of her general character, or of any of
the more detailed and particular ones, which will
explain the phenomena better than mine, I shall be
very willing to adopt it. Meanwhile, however, it
is fitting that a city, which not only looks down in
scorn upon the country to which she owes her daily
bread, but which affects to sneer at those whom
she must notwithstanding copy, and whom it is
utterly impossible that she can ever equal, should
be rebuked for her arrogance, and resisted when
she would claim that to which she neither has nor
can have the smallest title.</p>

<hr class="d6" />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Athens be the point at which the
whole politics of Scotland have their origin and
their termination; and, although the parties there
be more uniform and incessant in their hostility
than in the remote parts of the country; yet, it is
impossible to understand the composition, spirit,
and conduct of those parties, without premising a
few words on the general question.</p>

<p>Now, though England growls, and Ireland
brawls and fights, neither of them is perhaps so
degraded in its political system as Scotland. The
great body of the Scottish people may indeed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
said to have no political rights at all; and the
members that are sent to the House of Commons
as the representatives of Scotland, may just as properly
be considered the representatives of Bengal
or Barbadoes, with which they have often fully
as much connexion, and in the welfare of which
they are fully as much interested. In the Scottish
counties, the real proprietors of the soil are not
necessarily the voters for members of parliament;
and, in the royal burghs of Scotland, the great
body of the freemen and burgesses, instead of possessing
the parliamentary franchise, are almost necessarily
in opposition to those who do possess it.
Freeholds, in the Scottish counties, are held either
by charters directly from the King, or by charter
from subjects as their vassals. No part of the lands
in Scotland being now in the hands of the crown,
the extent of holdings by crown charter cannot be
increased; and, as the rents of the crown vassals
were valued a considerable time ago, an increase
of rent, either from the improvement of the estate,
or from any other cause, does not increase its political
value. None but those who hold of the crown,
and whose valued rents are of the stipulated amount,
can vote for members of parliament; though, if
the valued rental amount to any number of times
the sum necessary for a qualification, the holder of
the crown charter for that rental possesses as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
votes as the amount will bear. In theory, therefore,
there is a difference between the value of
Scotch property in land, and the representation of
that property in parliament. The value of the
land varies with the prosperity of the country,
while the extent of the representation remains the
same. This is an injustice; but it is by no means
the only or the greatest one of which the Scottish
landholder has to complain. The property in the
crown charter, or superiority, as it is called, is
different from the property in the land: the lands
may be sold, and the votes retained by the seller;
the votes may be sold, without selling the land;
or the land may be sold to one purchaser, and the
votes to another.</p>

<p>This system is productive of so many evils, that,
in many instances, a Scotch county representation
is substantially no representation at all. The local
interests and improvements of the counties are apt
to be neglected, the county interest is easily thrown
into the scale of any party or faction,&mdash;more especially
if that party or faction be subservient to the
administration,&mdash;and, as the county member, when
ministerial, has great influence over all the government
offices and patronage connected with the
county, the chances are, that these will be bestowed
upon persons who are either ignorant of their duties,
from a want of local knowledge, or disliked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
by the independent proprietors upon party grounds.
The old and decaying families, whose fallen fortunes
force them to sell their lands, and whose
pride as well as whose interest induces them to
retain their superiorities, for the purpose of turning
them to political account, are thus ranged in
opposition to the more active and intelligent, who,
by the exercise of their own talents, have acquired
the means of purchasing land; and thus, independently
of the old and theoretic distinctions of
tories and whigs, there is perhaps more to create
and render conspicuous the distinction between the
liberal and the servile, in the Scotch counties, than
in those either of England or of Ireland.</p>

<p>In the royal burghs of Scotland, the separation
between those who really possess the property and
are interested in the welfare of the burgh, and those
who are in possession of the elective franchise, is
still more glaring in its absurdity, and pernicious
in its effects. During the minority of James III.
of Scotland, in 1469, when that prince was only
seventeen years old, and when the turbulent nobles
were setting the laws at defiance, and, by bands of
armed ruffians in the streets, compelling the freemen
of the royal burghs to choose their creatures
as magistrates,&mdash;a statute was enacted, which was
deemed salutary at the time, but which has since
reduced the political influence of the whole burgesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of Scotland to a mere nonentity, and made the
Scotch burgh representation one of the most convenient
and efficient engines of corruption that ever
was devised. That statute gave to the official men,
seldom exceeding twenty in any burgh, and generally
the mere creatures of some chief or leader, who
frequently has no connexion with the burgh at all&mdash;the
power of electing their successors in office,&mdash;that
is, of placing the whole parliamentary franchise,
the whole revenues of the burgh, every species of
patronage that it can exercise, and every alteration
and improvement that it would require, solely and
irretrievably at the control and disposal of about
twenty persons, and giving it to them and their
assignees as a perpetual inheritance.</p>

<p>Now, although these twenty men should be the
most intelligent that each burgh could afford, yet,
as the people have no voice in the election of them,
and no control over the acts of their management,
however corrupt, pernicious, or ruinous, it is impossible
that they can be regarded as any thing else
than an useless and pernicious excrescence,&mdash;a local
despotism, of the most hurtful and humiliating
description, and a marketable commodity, always
willing to hire themselves to whoever should bribe
the highest. Circumstanced as they are, however,
it is impossible that they can be the most intelligent
men in their respective burghs. Being a minority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and a very small and insignificant one, public
opinion must always be against them; and this circumstance
alone has a degrading and debasing
tendency. The object of the leading men among
them must naturally be to preserve their own superiority
and influence; and therefore they must
naturally procure the election of recruits whose
wisdom shall not be dangerous to their own influence,
and whose feelings of honour shall have no
tendency to revolt at the iniquities of the system;
and thus, while the system is in itself as corrupting
as can well be imagined, it has a tendency to draw
towards it those who are both disposed and qualified
for being corrupted. The specimens of those
burghal office-bearers, which I had seen in the
Athens during the King’s visit, were to me a decided
proof of the badness of the system under
which they are appointed; and the derision in which
they appeared to be held by the people, and the
pleasure which their disappointments and rebuffs
seemed to afford, told plainly enough the estimation
in which they are held; and the Scotch are by
much too prudent and cautious a people not to
pitch their estimate, both of things and of persons,
in a very nice proportion to the value.</p>

<p>Now, independently of its mischievous political
effects, there is something in this system which is
peculiarly injurious to the local police and improvements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of Scotland. If the way in which those
local rulers are chosen gives general offence, and
if their own qualifications be so confessedly inferior
as to excite contempt, it is not possible that the
regulations which they frame, even assuming that
they could be good in themselves, could be carried
into effect with that decision, and supported with
that cordiality, on the part of the public, which a
wholesome police requires; as little is it likely that
such men, so appointed, could either plan judicious
and liberal improvements, or carry them into execution.
Opposed to the people in their very formation,
the people must be presumed to oppose them
in every part of their conduct where opposition is
practicable, and so annoy them in the rest of it as
to make them confine themselves to that&mdash;to which
indeed the whole spirit of the system is exceedingly
prone&mdash;their own personal importance and aggrandizement.</p>

<p>But it is with reference to the general politics of
Scotland as centring in the Athens, that this system
of burghal election exerts its most pernicious
and permanent influence; for whoever chooses to
go to the expense, (and where very weighty purses
are not run against each other that is by no means
great,) can purchase the votes of Scotch provosts,
bailies, and counsellors, with as much ease and
certainty as he could do the necks of as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
geese. No doubt there are temporary and local
exceptions, just as there have been wise legislators,
upright judges, and generous commanders, in the
very worst systems of despotism; but those exceptions,
from all that I could ever learn, have been
so few in number, and so far between, both in
space and in time, as not to diminish the truth of
the general likeness.</p>

<p>If indeed any other proof, than a knowledge of
the system, and a sight of the men, were wanted,
to show how extremely convenient a tool those
Scotch burghal magistrates are, in the hands of
whatever party has the political influence in Scotland
for the time, that proof would be found in
the great pertinacity with which the official men of
the Athens have fought for the preservation of the
system, and the miserable sophistications to which
they have been obliged to have recourse in order
so to disguise it as that it might be at all palatable
to the better informed or more liberal official men
in England. Within the last thirty years, the
burgesses of Scotland have made two strong and
almost unanimous efforts to shake it off. They
have shown how ruinous it is to themselves, how
degrading to the magisterial office, and how ill in
accordance with that freedom which England boasts.
But the lords advocate and other keepers of&mdash;what
shall I say?&mdash;Ay&mdash;their own places, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
worked about it and about it; and “darkened
counsel by words without knowledge,” till some
unfortunate circumstance of the times has enabled
them to couple the attempt at its destruction with
that with which it has no connexion&mdash;sedition and
rebellion against the British government. The one
attempt was spoiled by the breaking out of the
French Revolution, and the disturbances which at
that time took place in Scotland; and the subsequent
attempt failed in consequence of those grumblings
of the people, which were occasioned by a
time of scarcity of provisions and want of employment.</p>

<p>The state of the country representation, and the
system of the burgh government, would be in themselves
sufficient to lay the ministerial party in the
Athens open to suspicion, and to fill the rest of the
inhabitants with discontent. But these are heightened
by other circumstances. The judges, and
more especially the crown lawyers, have a power
over the people of Scotland, at which Englishmen
would stand aghast. The judges (no matter whether
they exercise it or not) have, directly or indirectly,
the power of nominating every one of the
jury by which a Scotchman is tried,&mdash;or, if they
have not this power in its full extent now, they
had it till very lately. In the case of ordinary
crimes, this power, though a theoretical imperfection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
might not be very dangerous in practice,&mdash;because,
in ordinary crimes, there is nothing to
entice a judge away from the natural dictates and
natural course of justice; but, in offences of a political
description, the case must be different,&mdash;because
all or at least a majority of the judges,
being persons who, at some period of their lives,
are helped forward by ministerial influence, cannot
be supposed to be entirely divested of those feelings
of gratitude which are natural to all classes and
conditions of men.</p>

<p>The lord advocate of Scotland is, from the very
nature of his office, much more a political character
than any judge. In all questions between the
King and his subjects, or between the people and
the criminal law, he is not only the King’s principal
officer, but the express representative of the
King himself; and, except in the truly kingly and
glorious attribute of granting pardon, he has more
ample powers than the King has by the law of
England. It is true, that, through the instrumentality
of his attorney-general, the King can file
warrants against such of his English subjects as
are guilty of offences, tending to injure his person,
or subvert his government, and bring them to trial
without the intervention of a grand jury; and it is
also true, that this power has been exercised in
cases where neither the person nor the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of the King could have been in the smallest danger;
but still, great as this power is in itself, and dangerous
as the frequent exercise of it is to liberty, it
is nothing in comparison of what the Scotch lord
advocate possesses. The attorney-general is always
understood to institute his proceedings in consequence
of a representation from the sovereign himself,
or from the great officers of the state; and, by
law, it is strictly confined to what are called state
offences. The lord advocate, on the other hand,
is, of his own pleasure, and without necessary consultation
with any one, not only the public prosecutor
in all cases of trial, but the arbiter who
decides who shall or shall not be tried; and, in the
latter capacity, he, of the plenitude of his own
power, performs all the functions of an English
grand jury. When a crime, either against society
or against the state, has been committed, or when
a person is suspected of the one or the other description
of crime, the procurator fiscal of the
district or burgh, (who, in many instances, is an
ignorant and bungling attorney, whose friends, or
whose secret services, have procured that office for
him, as much on account of his incapacity for
making a decent living by the ordinary practice of
his profession, as for any other reason,) takes
“a precognition,” that is, a secret and inquisitorial
examination of <i>ex-parte</i> evidence, which he transmits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to the lord advocate as the ground upon which
that officer may or may not proceed, just as he
pleases. If it please the lord advocate that the
party thus accused shall be indicted, he prepares
the necessary instruments; and the trial must be
begun, if the party accused shall petition the court
for it, within forty days of his being imprisoned,
and held to bail, and finished within other forty
days; but in all cases which come before the lords
of justiciary, either in their sessional court in the
Athens, or at their periodical circuits in the different
counties, the lord advocate is substantially
both the public prosecutor and the grand jury that
sends the case to trial. Where a special commission
of <i>oyer</i> and <i>terminer</i> is issued for the trial of
persons accused of high treason, a grand jury, of
not fewer than seventeen, and not more than
twenty-one, have a power of returning as true, or
ignoring the bills of indictment, if twelve of their
number shall be of that opinion. But, even with
this limitation, the power of the lord advocate,
more especially as relates to political offences, is
such as to heighten the animosity, which the state
of the elective franchise is calculated to produce,
between the comparatively small portion of the
Scottish people who are influenced by the hope or
possession of office, and the much larger portion
who are under no such influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The distance of the Athens from the seat of the
executive and legislative powers of the empire; and
the colouring which it is possible that a representation
may receive from those who carry it to headquarters,
also tend to lessen the confidence which
the people of Scotland might otherwise be disposed
to place in the men who form as it were the official
links of connexion between them and their King;
and when it is considered how much connexion and
influence can do even at headquarters, it is easy to
imagine how much greater their extent must be at
such an outpost as the Athens.</p>

<p>There would be no end of a statement of the
complaints which I found the independent Caledonians
had to make against their delegated authorities.
From what I saw in the Athens, and from
what I heard in my excursion over the country, I
could plainly discover that the people of Scotland
are perhaps more uniformly and more sincerely devoted
to all the better parts of the constitution, and
to the person and family of the King, than the
people of England; but I could at the same time
perceive that they felt towards the immediate
holders of Scottish power and office, a much
stronger dislike than is to be found in England.
At the same time, they all seemed anxious to make
it appear that those official men wished to identify
themselves, and even their failings, so much with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the general government of the country, that they
were ever ready to denounce accusations against
themselves as attacks on the government; and
many instances were mentioned to me in which a
very excusable, and, as I would have thought, a
very deserved ridicule of a small man of office, had
been considered and represented as the very next
step to levying war upon the King.</p>

<p>The tendency which the Athenians have to
make themselves, their sayings, and their doings,
the grand objects of thought and conversation,
helps to give currency and additional bitterness to
this political rancour. If a scrap of paper which a
procurator fiscal cannot read, or a sharp instrument
of which a loyal magistrate cannot exactly understand
the use, happen to be found in any district, more
especially in any of the populous and manufacturing
districts of Scotland, the chance is, that if
there be any symptom in the public mind which
sophistry can twist into an attitude of irritation,
the one shall find its way to the Athens as a seditious
circular, and the other as a rebellious pike.
The official men of the Athens have no great
knowledge of articles of these descriptions, and as
of late years the lords advocates in particular have
not only been a very sensitive and vigilant race,
but have been of those mental dimensions which
are the better for a discovery or two to give them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
importance, there have, during those years, been
things suspected of rebellious propensities, which
would have been regarded as quite harmless in
any other part of the island. A merchant who has
extensive dealings with Russia, and who is also
concerned in the north sea whale fishing, informed
me that in the memorable year 1819, a few letters
written in the Russian character, and two dozen of
harpoons, were taken from his warehouse with
great ceremony, forwarded to Edinburgh at considerable
expense, and, as he supposed, cost the authorities
there, not only much profound cogitation
among themselves, but an application to the secretary
of state, ere they were sent back to him. Indeed,
were I to recount all the transactions of this
description that were mentioned to me during my
residence in Scotland, I should fill several volumes
with instances of the lamentable and ludicrous
effects of uninformed zeal in official men: to record
such matters would, however, be an attempt
to preserve the memory of persons and things
which no effort could keep from oblivion.</p>

<p>In the peculiar politics of the Athens, it struck
me, that though there are only two parties,&mdash;the
men in office, with their connexions and dependants,
and the men who are not in office,&mdash;yet that
there are several distinct grounds of opposition,
some of which neither party are very willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
avow, and therefore they lump them all together
in the convenient cant terms of Tory and Whig.
Both parties are radically and substantially loyal;
and both parties, though in different degrees, and
sought for by different measures, may have a
regard for the prosperity of their country generally,
and for the glory and aggrandizement of the
Athens, in a particular and pre-eminent degree;
but still, their wars of the tongue, and the unpleasant
inroads which these wars make upon domestic
prosperity and happiness, are just as unpleasant
as though the one party were about to draw
the sword for absolute despotism, and the other for
blind and indiscriminate democracy.</p>

<p>The Athenian Tories are perhaps the most
place-devoted race in the British dominions. Office
is their god; and, as is sometimes the case with
other devotees, their devotion is fervent in proportion
to the feeling they have of their own unworthiness.
In defence of that which they worship, they
have no more variety of voice than the winged
warders of the Roman capitol. Hence, as I said
of the burghal magistracies, they cling to each
other, and by that very means separate themselves
more from the people than the necessity of the
case requires. Their strength consists, mainly, in
those imperfections of the elective franchise, and
powers of the law officers of the Crown, to which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
have alluded; and as those cannot well be defended
in argument, eloquence is of little use to
them, and they seem to have no great partiality for
those who possess it. When they make an attack
as a body, in any other way than through the instrumentality
of the law, (which they can employ
only when the waters of society are a little troubled,)
they do it snugly and covertly,&mdash;by letting
people feel that they have the dispensing of rewards;
by standing between a candidate and an office for
which he is qualified, or by something of a similar
kind. I was told that, at one period, and that not
a very remote one, they would hit a man whose
politics they did not like, through the medium of
his banker; but latterly, the will or the power, or
at any rate the practice of this, has been lessened, if
not abolished.</p>

<p>At some periods, indeed, they have shown direct
hostilities: they have spoken and written with considerable
loudness, and considerable license; but
the system, at least the local system, of which they
have undertaken the championship, has not furnished
them with sound principles or satisfactory
arguments; and their mode of conducting themselves
has shown that they were deficient both in
skill and in tact. They have been exposed, certainly,
and ashamed of themselves, very possibly.</p>

<p>The Athenian Whigs are a mixed multitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and though they all agree in their opposition to the
other party, they are by no means agreed among
themselves,&mdash;that is, as far as I could discover,
they are not all influenced by the same principles,
or seeking the same object. The party who are in
office, have always among their opponents, and frequently
foremost amongst them, a party whose
principles and disposition differ not much from
their own&mdash;namely, the party who wish to get in.
As, however, those longers for office cannot, like
the enjoyers of office, support themselves by their
politics, they have no principle of union, and therefore
do not, like the others, unfurl the ensigns, and
raise the war-cry, as a party. Were they to do
this, it would not only defeat their own object, but
cause them to be more disliked by the independent
part of the people, than the persons who are in
possession. Feeding, whether with pudding or
with place, has a tendency to smooth the turbulent
passions; while hungering, whether for food or for
office, has an effect exactly the opposite. Hence,
even the Athenian placeman, whose appetite is
most ravenous, and who is prone to snarl at those
whom he suspects of a desire to take his portion
from him, is the more civil from being in office,
unless when he thinks that his honours or emoluments
are in danger. Upon this principle, he is
kind to those whom he thinks indifferent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
polite, and occasionally generous, to all whom he
imagines can strengthen his influence, without
turning round in the end, and attempting to share
it with him. Hence, also, the place-hunter, I
mean him who hunts for it in opposition to the
present holder, is always irritable and jealous, and
keeps his wishes and his plans as much to himself
as ever he can. Thus, such of the Athenian
Whigs as would be placemen to the very core, if
they had “good opportunities for the ’ork,” are
careful to blend, and lose if possible, their peculiar
propensities, in the general mass of those who,
without any specific or immediate view to their
own personal interest, seek for a reform of what
they conceive to be the political abuses of their
country.</p>

<p>In this way, all that is selfish among the Athenian
Whigs can be kept in the back-ground; and as
the principles which they abet are much more
rational in themselves, much more agreeable to the
general feelings of mankind, and much better
adapted for declamation, than those which their
opponents profess&mdash;when they venture to profess
any thing, the Whigs always have had, and always
will continue to have, the best of the argument,
and the finest of the eloquence upon their side. But
though they be by far the most numerous, and the
most specious, their chances of success bear no proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
either to their numbers or the apparent
superiority of their cause. The opposite party
have the command of the public purse, and when
the two parties strive, they are thus enabled to
throw the expense of both sides upon their antagonists.
Such are a few of the principles and
practices of Athenian politics,&mdash;a war of words,
of which it would be no easy matter to define the
object, or calculate the end.</p>

But make their best advantages<br />
Of others’ quarrels, like the Swiss;<br />
And out of foreign controversies,<br />
By aiding both sides, fill their purses.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Butler.</span></p>

<hr class="d6" />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> airs the Athens may give herself in
other matters, however she may boast of her taste
and her elegance, talk of her science and her literature,
or cherish the mouldering skeleton of her
medical school, no one can be a day within her
precincts without discovering that the law is her
Alpha and her Omega,&mdash;the food which she eats,
the raiment she puts on, the dwelling-house which
she inhabits, the conversation in which she engages,
the soul which animates her whole frame, the mind
which is discovered in every feature of her countenance,
and every attitude of her body. Once destroy
that, or remove it to another place, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
pride of the Athens would be at an end: you might
lodge owls in all her palaces, and graze cattle in
all her streets.</p>

<p>From the way in which the Scottish courts of
law are regulated, there is hardly a suit from the
Solway Firth to the Pentland, or from Peterhead
to the remotest of the Hebudæ, which does not
look toward the Athens, the moment that the litigiousness
of a client, or the machinations of an
attorney, call it into existence. I hinted already,
that there is no one thing in which the Athens can
now retain a superiority except the practice of
Scotch law; and, as Scotland increases in wealth,
that law is so constructed, that the portion which
the scribes and spouters of the Athens shall be
enabled to levy upon their countrymen must always
increase in a greater ratio. Scotchmen are apt to
be proud of the Athens,&mdash;to regard her with a
portion at least of that admiration which subjects pay
to the pomp of their kings. There is propriety in
this; for there is scarcely a stone in the walls of
the Athenian palaces, or a decent coat in her streets,
which has not been squeezed out of some litigious
or unfortunate man of the provinces, in the shape
of a lawyer’s fee. I noticed the power which the
crown lawyers of Scotland have over the liberties
and lives of the people; and the power which lawyers
of another class have over the fortunes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Scotch lairds, is every jot as ruinous and humiliating.
There are complaints in England, that
when once property gets into chancery, the “infant”
becomes grey before he can enjoy it; but the Scottish
chancery is incalculably worse; for the moment
that a Scotch proprietor allows his lands to pass
into the keeping of an Edinburgh agent, from that
moment he must lay his account either with losing
them altogether, or purchasing them anew; and
to enumerate the heirs of Scottish families, who
are at any time pining away in heart-broken obscurity,
or toiling under the burning suns of the
East or the West, in the hope of winning back a
poor fragment of the ample heritage to which they
were born, would require no trifling succession of
pages.</p>

<p>It cannot indeed be otherwise. According to the
definition of the political economists, law is not
only unproductive labour in itself, but wherever it
clutches its talons, it tears away the funds by which
more valuable labour should be supported, and
distracts and lacerates the spirit by which those
funds should be applied. When a Scotchman from
the country visits the Athens, and sees a long line
of costly buildings mounting up in the air, he may
rest assured, that for every shilling that those
buildings cost, and every shilling that shall be
spent in them, he and his compatriots must pay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
The Athens herself,&mdash;the overtopping and overwhelming
part of the Athens,&mdash;that part which
rises by the power, and extends itself by the
weight, of the law, produces nothing whatever.
It is as sterile as the Castle rock; and, were it
not for the folly of other people, its ascendency
would not be so great as it makes the Athens feel.
This, however, is a matter for the Scotch themselves;
and it sometimes happens, with nations as
well as with individuals, that a deformity or a vice
is praised and cherished, while beauties and virtues
are treated with neglect.</p>

<p>It is matter of trite remark, that very few of the
seed of Jacob have ever taken up their abode in
the Athens, and that the few who have done so,
have in a short time been starved to death or to
removal; and it has sometimes been wondered
why a people, who have been so successful in pillaging
the other nations of Europe, should have
failed so completely in this instance. A very slight
acquaintance with the Athenian “men of business,”
as they are called, will explain the fact, and resolve
the difficulty. The man of business has all the
natural rapacity and cunning of the Jew, and he is
at the same time so well conversant with every
quirk and turn of the law, that there is no possibility
of calling him to account for his depredations.</p>

<p>Those hounds usually pursue their game in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
couples. There is one who is called “the dining
partner,” whose business it is to watch for every
inexperienced or expensive man of property, who
happens to be spending a few days in the Athens,
get invited to the same party with him, ply him
with flattery, and when his weak side is once discovered,
inflame his vanity upon that. Toward
the close of the party, when the wine has circulated
with that abundance and rapidity which are common
in such cases, the dining partner becomes
large in his professions of friendship. The victim
swallows the bait with avidity; a meeting takes
place in the kennel of the hounds next morning;
and a loan of a few thousand pounds, being upon
a first security, is negotiated in a manner which is
quite fair and equitable; but the men of the law,
when they go down to “take their infeftment”
over the lands, contrive to suggest so many improvements
that the supply is speedily exhausted;
and, as it has created much more appetite than it
has satisfied, another and a larger supply becomes
necessary. The terms of this are a little different:
money, which was in profusion upon the first occasion,
is now difficult to be had. More than the
legal interest would invalidate the security; but
matters may be so managed, as to give a bond for
payment of the interest, and repayment of the
principal of fifteen thousand pounds, while ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
thousand only is advanced. The gates of ruin are
now fairly opened; loan follows after loan, till the
whole value of the lands be mortgaged, and the
whole rents consumed in interest; and when matters
have come to this situation, the men of business
press a sale at a time which they know to be
disadvantageous, and thus get into their own possession
property, upon the improvement of which
almost the whole of the sums advanced by them
have been expended,&mdash;are, in short, much in the
same situation as if they had got a present of the
lands, and only laid out a few thousand pounds for
their improvement. It is not the object of the
men of business to retain a great deal of property
in land; so they divide the lands into lots, sell
them at a handsome profit, and retain the freehold
qualifications, either to promote their own political
interest, or to part with them for large sums in the
event of a disputed election,&mdash;a matter which they
are often known to bring about for this very purpose.
Such are some of the blessings which the
legal men of the Athens bestow upon their country,
in return for the fees with which it has previously
fattened them.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding many examples of this
kind, there remains among that part of the Athenian
lawyers, who go by the name of “men of business,”
no small degree, both of talent and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
integrity, while, among the “men of profession,”&mdash;the
advocates, or members of the Scotch bar, there
are a few, for the reasons that were formerly
stated, the very choicest spirits, not of the Athens
merely, but of all Scotland. Though the occasions
upon which these persons display their eloquence
be merely of a private nature,&mdash;though a very
large proportion of them have no eloquence to
display, or no opportunity for displaying it; yet
the profession of advocate is the only one in Scotland
which makes the professor of it a gentleman;
and among the people of the Athens, of all classes,
the special pleaders before the Courts of Session
and Justiciary,&mdash;the supreme civil and criminal
courts of Scotland, take a deeper hold of the public
mind in the Athens, and engross a greater
share of the public attention, than the orators of
St. Stephen’s do in the British Metropolis.</p>

<p>One reason of this may be the way in which the
different courts are blended together, and in which
business is conducted. The Court of Session is a
court of equity, as well as a court of law; and
this is extremely favourable for the pleader, as the
two characters blended together in the same oration
give it a rich and popular character, which it can
never have in the stiff formality of the English
courts. Great part of the pleadings, too, are
written; and this not only keeps the inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
speakers from lowering the general tone of the bar,
but enables the more celebrated to confine themselves
to such general arguments as are best calculated
for oratorical display. Another thing: criminal
trials, which are ever the most interesting
to the public, are not managed by the fag-end of
the law, as at the Old Bailey; and the counsel for
the prisoner is not limited to legal exceptions in
the course of the trial, cross-questionings of witnesses,
and motions in arrest of judgment and
mitigation of punishment, after the jury have returned
their verdict, and are beyond the reach of
his eloquence, however touching or powerful. In
the Scotch criminal court, whether in the Athens
or at the provincial assizes, the law itself takes
care that the prisoner, whatever be his crime, shall
have the aid of counsel; and if the crime be remarkable,
either from its enormity or on account of
the character or rank of the party accused, then
the very first counsel at the bar are ranged on his
side. These are allowed full scope, both to attack
the form of the case <i>in limine</i>, and to throw every
suspicion upon the evidence, and make every appeal
to the judgments and passions of the jury, that
ingenuity can suggest, or eloquence apply. The
official men who have the conducting of the prosecution,
are not only, generally speaking, men of much
smaller abilities than those who have the conducting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of the defence, but upon political grounds, as
well as from that general aversion which men have
to the sanguinary operations of the law, the feeling
of the public is opposed to them, and in favour of
their antagonists.</p>

<p>There was nothing, indeed, with which I ever
was better pleased, or in which I felt Old England
so much inferior to her northern neighbour, as in
the conducting of criminal trials. One who is in
the habit of looking in at that great suttling-house
for the gallows, the Old Bailey,&mdash;who sees the hurried
manner in which the life of a man is, perhaps
justly enough, sworn away,&mdash;who listens to the few
seconds of advice, and the few trifling questions
put by the counsel to whom the poor culprit has
given the last shilling that he could beg from his
weeping relations,&mdash;who marks the anxiety of the
counsel till the case shall come to that point at
which he may coldly abandon his miserable client&mdash;the
very point at which an appeal to the jury might
turn the scale,&mdash;cannot but feel, when he witnesses
the slow and pathetic solemnity of the Scotch
courts, that he is among pleaders of other powers.
A case which brings even Theisseger to the bar, is
one of no common importance, and one never by
any chance finds the powers of Brougham, or the
acuteness of Scarlett, come in to save a poor man
from death. But when I was in the Athens, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
was only one trial for a capital crime, and yet the
legal sagacity of Moncrieff, and the burning eloquence
of Jeffrey, were exerted for full two hours,
on behalf of the prisoner; and exerted, too, in
such a manner as convinced me that the fee must
have been the very least part of their inducement.
I never heard objections put with so perfect a
knowledge both of the general principles of law,
or the specialities of the particular case, or evidence
so scientifically dissected, as were done by
the former; and the appeal of Jeffrey to the feelings
of the jury, and even to those of the judges,
was one of the finest things I ever heard. There
are many men far more learned in the law than this
celebrated Scotchman; and many who can take a
far more sweeping and comprehensive view of a
subject; but all the little sallies of which his speech
consisted, were as sharp as needles and as shining
as diamonds. Their brilliancy made you open
your bosom to receive them, and their keenness was
such that they would have pierced their way in
spite of you. Their effect upon the crowded spectators,
and upon the jury, was tremendous; nor
was the lord justice clerk himself, who seemed not
only a very proud and consequential person in himself,
but by no means a hearty admirer of the
barrister, able to resist the influence. Whenever
Jeffrey tore away a pillar of the evidence against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
his client, and clenched the advantage by an appeal
to those passions which he seemed to know so well
how to touch, there was a general hum of satisfaction
in the crowd; the jurors looked up with eyes of
new hope, as much as to say, “we shall be able to
acquit him yet;” and the judge relaxed a little of
the lofty severity of his countenance.</p>

<p>Another cause why the people of the Athens,
and of Scotland generally, set so high a value upon
the Athenian advocates, may be that they are the
only class of persons among whom public speaking
is so much as known. I do not mean to say that
the Scotch have no talents for this kind of display.
Quite the reverse; for instead of taciturnity, which
their supposed cautious character would lead one
to set down as their leading propensity, they are
the most loquacious people,&mdash;I mean the longest-winded
people that ever I met with; having, in
their common conversation, ten times as much
<i>badinage</i> and ornament as the English, and ten
times more concatenation of ideas than the Irish.</p>

<p>But they have no subject to excite public speaking,
and no occasion upon which to exercise it.
Elections they have none, not even so much as a
parish-meeting, or a wardmote. The only persons
among them that have the privilege of electing
even their own local managers, are “the Trades,”
or little corporations of artificers, in the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
burghs, who annually choose “deacons;” but they
usually do this more by the eloquence of liquor
than of words, and as the deacons are commonly a
sort of pack-horses to the burghal corporation,
they fall into most of the sensual and senseless
vulgarity which are the characteristics of it.
Churches and hospitals supported by voluntary
contribution, at the annual festivals of which the
contributors may make speeches, there are none.
Indeed, unless a Scotchman were to stand on a
hill-side and address the wind, or on the sea-shore
and address the waves, he has no scope for oratory;
and thus, come from what part of the country he
may, the pleadings before the courts at the Athens,
are quite a novelty to him, and he runs after
and admires them as such. Thus the total absence
of all eloquence throughout the country, makes
a very small portion of it obtain distinction in the
Athens.</p>

<p>Curious as it is to find a city where every soul is
so much absorbed by the law, that men and women,
girls and boys, of all ages and all conditions
of life, season their common speech with the slang
of legal phrases, and destructive of not only all
literary and liberal taste, but of all the joyous intercourse
of life, as it is to hear every night a rehearsal
of Jeffrey’s sarcasm, or Cockburn’s joke of the morning;
yet the Parliament-house of the Athens is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
spirit-stirring scene, and very delightful, compared
with the gloomy desolation of Westminster-hall.</p>

<p>While the courts are sitting it is usually as crowded
as the Royal Exchange at four o’clock, and the
hum, and bustle, and eagerness, are vastly more
interesting than the solemn faces and demure looks
of the dealers in tallow and tapioca, who stand
under the shadow of the Grasshopper, with their
jaws distended like a trap for foxes, and their
hands up to their elbows in their pockets, as if they
could not abstain from fumbling money, even when
the precise minute of bargain has not arrived.</p>

<p>It is true that you meet with no Rothschild, or any
other pawnbroker for kings, in this ancient apartment
of the Scottish Parliament; but, if you be
more a lover of mind than of money, you are sure
to meet with what will please you a great deal better.
Before the Judges have taken their places in
the Inner Courts, you cannot miss the tall figure,
the gleesome grey eye, the snub nose, and all the
other characteristics of the spirit of the wizard and
the soul of the man, that mark Sir Walter Scott.
A dozen of chosen friends, some Whig and some
Tory, hang about him; and, as he limps along
with wonderful vigour, considering the irregularity
of his legs, peals of laughter ring at every word
which he utters, and a score of fledgling Tory barristers,
who have not yet got either a place or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
brief, stretch out their goose necks, huddle round,
and cackle at the echo of that which they cannot
possibly hear. In another place, or rather in all
places, the Editor of the Edinburgh Review starts
about like wildfire; and unless it be when an attorney
ever and anon brings him up with the sheet-anchor
of a fee and a brief, there is no possibility of arresting
his motion. He darts aside like lightning, runs
over the brief with such rapidity that you would
think he were merely counting the pages of an article
for the Edinburgh Review, and having handed
it to his clerk, who seems as heavy as himself is
agile, he again darts into the throng, like an otter
into the waters, and is seen no more till he bring up
another gudgeon.</p>

<p>Wherever you meet with this highly-gifted personage,
you are never at a loss to distinguish him
from every body else. His writings, his speeches,
and his face, have the most remarkable family likeness
that I ever met with. All the three seem cut into
little faucettes and angles, which glitter and sparkle
in every possibility of light, both direct and oblique.
In the speech and the writing, rich as is the
play of genius on the surface, it bears no proportion
to the mass of intellect which it covers and
dazzles; and keen, acute, and purged of all grossness
and obesity, as is the lower part of the face, it
bears no proportion to the expansion of forehead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
that towers above. Jeffrey has the most wonderful
pair of eyes that ever illuminated a human visage.
Even when he is shooting along like a small but
swift meteor through the crowd in the Parliament-House,
they are beaming so as to force you to turn
away your eyes, and if he looks at you, you find
yourself utterly unable to withstand it. When that
look is darting for any important purpose, such as
to ascertain whether a witness be or be not speaking
the truth, it is more searching than that of Garrow
even in his best days, so that the most hardened
tremble before it, and are instantly divested of all
power of concealing the truth. If, however, you
attempt to repay Jeffrey in his own coin, by working
into his mind with that sharp and anatomical
glance which he employs in dissecting the minds
of other people, you find that you are woefully mistaken.
Those eyes, which can penetrate to the
bottom of any other man’s heart, and expose even
that part of it which he studies with the greatest
assiduity to conceal, are a perfect sealed book to
you; you cannot see beyond their external surface,
and they give you not so much as a hint of what the
owner is thinking, or what he may be disposed to
say or do next. Wonderful as the eyes are, they
are perhaps exceeded by the eyebrows, and certainly
two such intellectual batteries were never alternately
masked and displayed in a manner so singular.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
They range over a greater extent of surface, and
twist themselves into a more endless variety of curves
than is almost possible to conceive, and while they
do so, they express all manner of thoughts, and utter
all descriptions of sentences. Few men have more
eloquence in their speech than Jeffrey, and I have
met with none who had half as much in his face.</p>

<p>Another character in this reeling crowd, which
never fails to attract the attention of a stranger, is
that of Robert Forsyth. As far as one man can be
unlike another, he is the very antipodes of Jeffery.
He is large, square, and muscular, more intended by
nature, you would think, for breaking stones on the
high road, than for breaking syllogisms before their
Lordships. His face is coarse, broad and flat, and
as immovable in all its muscles as though it had
been chiselled out of a block of granite. As he
moves along, he turns his head neither to the one
side nor to the other; and indeed he does not require
it, for his eyes have that divergent squint
which enables him at once to scan both sides of the
horizon. The lines of labour are so ploughed
across and across every part of his ample countenance,
and they give it so knotted and so corrugated
an appearance, that you can easily perceive
he has followed more occupations, and been
attached to more sides of politics than one. Still
there is by no means the quiescence of a mind at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
ease upon the strong picture of his visage; the
lower part of it is fixed in something between a
half laugh and a half grin, and the upper part has
a firmness about it which tells you he is a through-going
lawyer, whom it will not be easy to turn from
his purpose.</p>

<p>The throng is so great, however, and the variety
of faces, gowned and ungowned, wigged and unwigged,
beaming forth every shade of mind, and betokening
every degree of mental vacuity, is so perplexing,
that your eye and your imagination are
completely bewildered, and you cannot attend either
to individuals or single groups, while the buz of
voices of so many different tones and pitches give
your ears the impression of a very Babel.</p>

<p>Business commences; the Lords Ordinary take
their seats&mdash;in places which make them look more
like as if they were standing in the pillory than any
thing else. But even there, advocates are drudging
in their vocations; agents running backwards and
forwards with briefs; clients watching the result
with palpitating hearts; and the Athenian loungers
hanging about, anticipating their Lordships in the
decision of the several cases. The well-employed
advocates now put you very much in mind of shuttle-cocks.
They run from bar to bar, making motions
here and speeches there, in the most chaos-looking
style that can be imagined. Of the whole gown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and wig mass, it is but a small portion, however,
who are thus occupied; four-fifths of the whole
keep trudging on from end to end of the hall, and
seem never to expect or even to get a fee; while the
bar clerks collected round the fire-places keep up a
continual titter at the repetition of all the good
jokes of the day; and the same scene continues day
after day, and month after month. You are astonished
that a place, the real business of which is
so dull and so dry, should have charms for so many
idle people; but except this Parliament-house there
is not another in-door lounge in the whole Athens;
and as the business of the courts forms the chief
topic of the evening’s conversation, many attend for
the purpose of qualifying themselves for displays
upon a very different arena. It is long before a
stranger can bring himself to relish this first and
most favourite of all Athenian pleasures. I, for
one, got tired of it in two or three days, and began
to be of opinion that, however much this fondness
for legal proceedings may sharpen the wits of the
Athenian idlers, it is but a sorry treat for those who
have no wish either to get rich by the acting, or
wise by the suffering of the law.</p>

<p>When the business of the day is over, you can
perceive the veteran barristers taking council together
as to where they may be joyous for the night;
and the younger legal men of all descriptions hurrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
off toward Princes Street, in order that they
may show themselves to the Athenian fair, before
they retreat to drown the daily badgerings in the
nightly bowl.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">IF</span>, in her metropolitan status as the seat of Caledonian
law, the Athens be fixed as the dog-star,
as the seat of Caledonian learning, she has been
and must be, changeful as the moon. If the wealth
of her lawyers “swells like the Solway,” the renown
of her philosophers “ebbs like its tide.”
The very same cause which raises the one,&mdash;which
makes all hearts envy, all eyes admire, all knees
worship, and all tongues speak the Babylonish
dialect of special pleaders, comes cold and curdling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
as December’s ice over every thing else; and though
there may be an occasional spring of the living
water of the mind, which has its source too deep,
or its current too thoroughly imbued with the
immortal fire, for submitting to the cold congelation;
yet such glorious instances must be few and
far between. Even in the law itself, there may be
green branches, just as there are green branches on
the Upas; but, like the Upas, the law, or indeed any
thing else which is so overpowering in its influence
as the law is in the Athens, must in itself monopolize
all the greenness, and etiolate and wither every
thing that attempts to grow under its broad and
gloomy shade. Whatever promises the chief reward
will, under any circumstances, always attract
the chief talent; and the state of the whole British
dominions, and of the Athens not less than any
other portion of them, is at present such as not to
be exceedingly favourable to the pursuits of abstract
and recondite philosophy. Luxury has found
out for all those who have money to spend without
working for it,&mdash;whether they have it as a legitimate
heritage from their natural parents, or as the
adopted children of that great nursery-mother of
idlers, the state, abundant employment,&mdash;full occupation
from every hour that they can snatch
from the pangs of intemperance and the pillow of
sleep, not only without profound philosophy, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
without thought of any description that reaches
beyond the enjoyment of the moment; and the
number of these persons, especially the latter division
of them, is so very considerable, that, of the
remaining independent portion of the British people,
none can afford to be philosophic or learned
upon any other terms than those of being paid for
it,&mdash;taking it up, and following it as a trade, as
much as other men do the boring of cannon, or
the building of bridges. That this is unquestionably
true of the whole country, may be established
from the philosophical publications, whether regular
or periodical, which make their appearance at
the present day. Of the regular class, there has
not, so far as I know, been published, within the
last thirty years, in any part of the British dominions,
a single original work, that will transmit
the name of its author to posterity. There
have indeed been books, and books in which there
have been the details of new experiments, and occasionally
scraps of theories; but, like successive
days in the kalendar, the one has usurped the place
and extinguished the remembrance of the other; and,
at the present moment, the most unmarketable article
which an author could carry to a bookseller would
be a profound treatise on any of the sciences.
With regard to periodical learning again, (I use
the word “learning” as distinguished from and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
even opposed to literature,) the case is very nearly
the same. The philosophical journals, of all the
periodicals, have the most limited circulation, are
the least read, and the least worth the reading,&mdash;just
because the proprietors of them cannot afford
to pay for the labour which it would require to
make them better.</p>

<p>Now, if this be the case with the British dominions
generally, and with the British metropolis,
where every species of talent has the means of
being stimulated to the greatest exertion, and where
every exertion meets with the most ample reward,
much more must it be the case in the Athens,
where there is not only no adequate remuneration
for the labours of learning, but where there is a
more honoured and rewarded pursuit, constantly
soliciting the choice, not only of the Athenian, but
of the Scottish talent generally, away from it. It
cannot be hoped, that when a man of very ordinary
talents can get a comfortable living and honourable
distinction in society, by managing the estates of
Scotch lairds, or the causes of Scotch litigants, men
of superior ability will consent to starve in obscurity
for the love of learning or of science. Mankind
have become to the full as mercenary in their intellectual
as in their civil marriages; and the Athenian
muses, like the Athenian maidens, pine in unwooed
neglect, because they have no dowry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The Athenian University was long the boast of
the Athens, not only as a school of philosophy, and
a school of medicine, but as a general school of
learning; and, with the exception, perhaps, of the
latter, the titles were, in the case of a few illustrious
men, well earned. Those times have, however,
gone by, and the Athenian university, pressed
down by the general circumstances of the Athens,
and yet more by the peculiar circumstances of its
own patronage, has sunk to rise no more.</p>

<p>Universities, indeed, have much of the general
character of stars,&mdash;they shine brightest when all
else is dark, and fade, if they do not disappear,
when illumination becomes general. While the
people, generally speaking, are ignorant, they are
lights in the path of learning; but when the people
become generally well informed, they are not much
better than lumber. This would be their fate in
general illumination, under any circumstances; but
it is peculiarly so, in the circumstances under which&mdash;or
rather, in spite of which, knowledge is at
present spreading over the British dominions. The
same cause which renders abstract studies unprofitable,
must render the systems of universities
unpopular, except in so far as the name of being
there is necessary for professional purposes; and
where the name is all that men actually need, they
will not burden themselves with much of the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
named. If it were not that there are such things
as fellowships, fat dinners, facilities for juvenile
dissipation, church and other livings, a key to
certain offices, and a general nominal eclât, which
in so far serves as a substitute for real information,
it is very possible that several halls in Oxford and
Cambridge would be abandoned to bats and spiders,&mdash;that
“the two eyes of England” would be
left “for daws to peck at;” and it was pretty
plain to me, from the general tenour of the Athenian
feeling, as expressed in the Athenian speech,
that, if the attendance of certain classes of her university
were not required for those who plaster
the consciences of Caledonian sinners, and who
bring down the tone of the Caledonian pulse, or
the Caledonian purse, her learned Thebans would
be allowed to deliver their prelections to the stones
in the wall, and the beam of the timber. In as far,
therefore, as I could see and reason from circumstances,
there is much, both in the feeling of the people
in the Athens, and in the causes by which that
feeling is produced, to render the decline of learning
certain on the one hand, while there is little or
nothing of a counteracting tendency on the other.</p>

<p>In addition to this, in as far as the university is
concerned, there is the infliction of perhaps the
very worst patronage that could be devised or even
imagined. I have noticed already, what a precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
piece of work the corporations, or, as they are
termed, “the councils” of the royal burghs are in
Scotland. In itself, there is nothing to render that
of the Athens better than any of the others; and,
in close juxtaposition with it, there is something
which tends to make it worse. The whole town-councils
in Scotland are, their attention to their
own personal interests excepted, ignorant, unreasoning,
and passive tools in the hands of the ruling
faction. If the actual leaders of that faction have
not their actual residence in the Athens, it is there
that they find the hands which do their work.
Those hands belong to men, who not only have
a better education than the Athenian magistrates,
but who perform more important functions, and
perform them in the face, and for the weal or the
woe of the whole of Scotland. To them, therefore,
the magistrates of the Athens are inferior;
and this circumstance, taken in conjunction with
the inferiority which the whole system of the Scotch
burghs tends to stamp upon the magistrates, renders
the said civic rulers of the Athens the most
unfit patrons of a school of philosophy, or indeed
of any thing learned or liberal, that human imagination
could devise. Not only this; but the superior
talents, at least the superior pretensions, of the
other functionaries alluded to, will throw the civic
worthies into their train as followers; and thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
whatever patronage they exercise, will have to
sustain, in addition to their own sheer dulness, the
dead deadening weight of the party politics of the
country,&mdash;a combination of stupidity and slavery,
under which that system were either greater or less
than human, which could flourish in a rational and
liberal manner.</p>

<p>When it is known that the provost, bailies, counsellors,
and deacons of the Athens,&mdash;seldom men
of any education, and never men of any genius,&mdash;<i>cum
avisamento eorum ministrorum</i>, (which,
being interpreted, signifies “without benefit of
clergy,”) have the sole power of electing the greater
number of professors in the Athenian university,&mdash;when
it is considered that the remaining ones are
nominated by the crown, in other words, by the
leading faction in Scotland for the time,&mdash;and when
it is borne in mind that the said provosts, bailies,
counsellors, and deacons, are little else than a pair
of bagpipes, upon which the said faction discourses
whatsoever music it chooses,&mdash;it will become but
too apparent, that the chances of having the professors’
chairs filled by the very fittest men possible
are about as small as can well be estimated.
That ignorant men should have the power of appointing
professors of learning is in itself a very
great absurdity; and that the ignorant men to
whom such a power is delegated, should themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
be tacked to the tail of a political faction for the
purpose of retaining places, contrary both to reason
and their own abilities, makes the matter, theoretically
considered, a great deal worse. I have
no wish to accuse the civic archons of the Athens
of wilful abuse in the exercise of this patronage;
but I have seen them, I have heard them speak,
and I have noticed the estimation in which they
are held; and, by a very charitable induction
from all these circumstances, I cannot help coming
to the conclusion, that they are totally incapable,
of their own knowledge, of determining who is,
or who is not, a fit person for being porter to the
Athenian college, far less professor of the humblest
art or science held forth upon within its walls,
not even excepting the professor of agriculture, or,
as he is aptly termed, “the doctor of dunghills.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, though in times past, and not very
long past, there have been found, in sundry chairs
of the Athenian university, men who would have
done honour to any college in any country, I looked
for a continuation of men of the same talents and
eminence; but though I looked for them, I found
them not. The time has not long gone by, when
the principal of that university was numbered, if
not with the most learned and profound, at least
with the most elegant of historians; but I should
be glad to be informed of what person, or thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
or circumstance, the being that I found holding the
supreme sway in the Athenian university, and in
its metropolitan name, presenting himself before
the King, as a specimen and representative of all
the universities of Scotland, could write the history.
It is true, that the office of this person is not much
else than a sinecure, as he seldom comes before the
public, except when his name stands rubric to a
diploma; but, if an image is found with a wooden
head, people are apt to turn away, without any
very much examination of the limbs. It is said,
more wittily than wisely perhaps, among the fledglings
at the seats of science in the south, that
“whatever may be the walls, the heads of houses
are most commonly of lead;” and the saying might
be carried to the Athens, if it were worth the
trouble. I was told that, if at some former point
of Athenian history, this personage had not been
a bachelor, and the daughter of a quondam provost
of the Athens a damsel to be wooed, the
college of the Athens might have gone all unprincipaled
for him; but the Athenians are so prone
to drill holes in the glory of each other, that one
never knows how much of their story to believe.</p>

<p>Still, if the nomination of the masters of Eton
and Winchester, and the doctors of Isis and Cam,
were deputed to the corporation of London, England
would tremble for her learned fame; and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
no one can deny that the court of aldermen, notwithstanding
the mental and corporeal obesity of
which they are accused, are far more promising
patrons for such purposes, than the town-council
of the Athens. Their own election depends upon
a greater number of persons, and before they can
carry it, they must have some superiority over the
freemen of their ward,&mdash;the means of flattering and
bribing them, if nothing else; but, in the Athens,
there is not the smallest test of talent previous to
a man’s being chosen an elector of professors; and,
therefore, no pledge that he either will or can
exercise that function in a proper manner.</p>

<p>The “<i>avisamentum eorum ministrorum</i>” has
no tendency to amend the matter; for the advice
which these worthies are most likely to give, is,
that themselves are the fittest of all possible professors,&mdash;a
proposition, of which the theoretical
doubts are great, and they are not lessened by
experience.</p>

<p>The ministers of the Edinburgh kirks, appointed
by the same persons as the professors,
may be presumed to be appointed upon the same
principles; and thus, though they were conjoined
with the others, in the university nominations, it
would be but an increase of the evil,&mdash;the addition
of the political son to that of the political
father; or, as Professor Leslie would express it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
“a combination of direct and retroflected dulness.”</p>

<p>In consequence of these circumstances, the <i>eorum
ministrorum</i> have usurped every professor’s chair
in the Athenian college which can be by any sophistry
twisted into a compatibility with the functions
of a minister of the Kirk. After the very
Reverend personage who, as aforesaid, groans under
the load of the principality (not of Wales), the
chairs, not only of divinity, church history, and Hebrew,
but of logic and rhetoric, and the belles lettres,
are in the hands of the Athenian priests. Now,
though a parson <i>in esse</i> be the most likely person to
teach divinity and church history, because those
who are parsons <i>in posse</i> are the only persons that
are likely to dip deeply into such studies; though,
in a country where Jews do not thrive, it be a matter
of no great moment who shall teach Hebrew,
and though logic and rhetoric, as they are usually
taught, be no weighty matters, yet there are substantial
reasons why no officiating clergyman in the
Athens should hold any chair whatever in the
college.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Kirk of Scotland, at least
according to her book of discipline, recognises no
clergyman who does not perform the whole of his
duties in his own person. She will have no “dumb
dogs who cannot bark,” and if they bark to the extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that she points out, they will have no strength
left even to hunt syllogisms in <i>Bar-ba-ra</i>, or to nozzle
up Hebrew roots. The minister of the Kirk is, by
its constitution, presumed not only to reside in his
parish, and perform divine service every Sunday, but
to devote the whole of the week, that is, as much of
<i>every</i> day of it, as other men of a similar rank in
life are supposed to devote to business, to visiting his
people at their houses, and receiving their visits at
his own, instructing and catechising the young,
recommending the destitute to the charity of the
Kirk Session, praying by the bed-side of the dying,
and performing a number of other little offices of
religion and charity, which are supposed to be imperiously
binding upon him in virtue of his solemn
vow of ordination. Ministers of the Kirk are furthermore
not understood to purchase their annual
stock of “<i>Conciones Selectæ</i>” in the booksellers’
shop, as is the case in some other places; and thus
every spare hour from the parochial duties of the
week is presumed to be taken up in preparing for
the pulpit duties of the Sunday. Hence a minister
of the Scottish Kirk, who is in the possession of
a cure, cannot, in conscientious accordance with the
oath that he takes when he is inducted, or with the
practical duties which he ought to perform, accept
of a professorship even of divinity or Hebrew.
Either the church-living should be such as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
occupy by its duties and reward by its emoluments,
the whole of the incumbent’s time, or it should
be so altered as to bring it to this state.</p>

<p>With regard to the professorships, again, it is
extremely doubtful whether even such of them as
divinity and church history can be profitably placed
in the hands of the parsons; at any rate, one would
very naturally think that the duties of a professor’s
chair should be sufficiently arduous for occupying
the whole of a mind as large as that which falls to
the ordinary run of clerical persons; while, in the
case of those of logic and rhetoric, the arts required
in the Parliament-House, the grand theatre of logical
wrangling and rhetorical display, not only in
the Athens, but for all Scotland, the clumsy concatenation
and leaden style which I heard, even in the
Athenian pulpits, are strong presumptive evidence
against the propriety of having them intrusted to
clerical hands.</p>

<p>But it is not to those professorships alone that
<i>eorum ministrorum</i> aspire. Not many years have
gone by since the whole Athens was thrown into
confusion, because one of the brethren was not permitted
to squelch his carcass into the chair of mathematics,
and become the successor of MacLaurin,
and Stewart, and Playfair; and had he succeeded,
the Athenians would perhaps ere now have had a
clerical expounder of “Dirlton’s Doubts” in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
chair of law, and a holder forth in the Tron Kirk
wielding the anatomical scalpel during the week.
The objections taken to the better-qualified candidate
upon that occasion, were such as to throw considerable
light upon the feeling of <i>eorum ministrorum</i>
toward the university, and to enable one to
form a pretty accurate guess at what will be its
state if their unquenchable longing for it shall ever
be fully satisfied. The exception which they took
was a grave charge of infidelity, founded upon an
allusion to David Hume, contained in a note to a
purely philosophic book, and a book, too, which,
both from its subject and its style, was never likely
to get into general circulation, and would be read
by nobody, merely on account of the note&mdash;the only
part which was impugned as being contrary to the
canons of orthodoxy.</p>

<p>It must be allowed that, if its patronage were at
all in decent hands, the constitution of the Athenian
university is not bad. The salaries of the professors
are all so small that if the livings are worth the acceptance
of men of talent, they must be chiefly made
up of the small annual fees payable by the students.
This is a very wholesome plan, and tends more to
reward every one according to his real merits than
that which obtains at most other places. The patronage,
however, with the three elements of civil
ignorance, political influence, and clerical intrigue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
arranged against the single and undefined good of
the institution, is more than enough to paralyze all
the good which that principle, properly supported,
or even let alone, would be capable of effecting.</p>

<p>Those evils have begun to pervade the whole
system. As the Athens is the grand seat of lawyers,
there will always be students for the law classes,
increasing with the increase that there is for lawyers;
but in every thing else the poison of decay has been
infused, and the decay itself has become visible.
With the exception of Leslie, who has written some
very flaming articles in the Edinburgh Review, and
some books in which the path to geometry is made
a little more thorny than ever; of Jamieson, who has
been most learned on slate and granite; and Wilson,
who has indited some pretty lake poetry, and some
pitiful political prose, of which he is said to be
now highly ashamed,&mdash;I did not hear that any of
the Athenian professors have put in a single claim
for immortality. Even in her anatomical school,
that upon which she rested her fame the longest
and the most securely, the recent falling off has
been great; and of all those who now shine in the
lists of her <i>senatus</i> there is none able to hold the
book for Gregory, or the scalpel for old Monro, or
light the furnace for Black. I understand that for
the fragments of her medical school that remain, the
Athens is almost wholly dependant upon private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
lecturers; that the students pay their fees and enter
their names at the college, not with any view of
attending the classes there, but because the fees
and entries are necessary for the ceremony of graduation.
But for the celebrity of her professors,
the Athens possesses no advantages as the locality
of a medical school. From the nature and pursuits
of the Athenian society, there is neither that variety
of patients, nor that variety of cases, which is found
in cities even of equal population, where a large
portion of the people are engaged in manufactures.
That it is as good in this respect as Glasgow begins
to be doubted, as a considerable number of
medical students now attend the Glasgow college in
preference; and that it is any way comparable to
London, as a school of surgery, no one can suppose.
If the medical glory of the Athenian college
continue to decrease as it has done for some time,
that college will soon become, like the Athens herself,
a pensionary upon the law and the politics of
Scotland.</p>

<p>But if there be those causes of mortality in the
college, there is not much hope of life in any of
the other philosophic institutions of the Athens.
Royal societies are no where much better than
coteries of old wives; and, judging from their
recent pursuits, that of the Athens can form no
exception to the general character. That a poet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and novelist should be the president of such an
institution, is proof that the number of Athenian
philosophers cannot be great; and however successful
and deserving of success such a person may
be in his other and lighter capacity, he is not the
most likely man to give soundness and solidity to
the speculations of philosophers. The fact is, that
with the exception of the teacher of a class, and
the editor of an Encyclopedia, (who are of course
but very heavy and humdrum persons,) and a
wisdom-struck squire or two, who take to the
amusement of the small philosophy of mosses and
muscle-shells rather than the small carpentry of
snuff-boxes and fiddles, and who would be quite
eclipsed in any other place, there is nothing in the
Athens which can be called an amateur philosopher,
and of the professional ones I have already
spoken.</p>

<p>In their philosophical opinions, the Athenians
are an absolute pendulum; and when the history of
their swingings this way and that way is looked at,
they seem to be a pendulum which has no continued
stimulus of motion, but of which the oscillations,
though not fewer in number, gradually become
more and more insignificant in range. While
David Hume was lord of the ascendant, the Athenians
doubted every thing but their own wisdom
and importance; under Adam Smith, they considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
“moral sentiments” as being valuable only
in “theory,” and learned “economy” in their
“politics,” by bringing all their disposable votes
and vices to the best market. Under Robertson,
they knew all history; and with Blair, every sentence
was taken from the storehouse of the Belles
Lettres, and measured by the gauge of Rhetoric.
When Reid and Dugald Stewart turned the tables
upon the sceptics, the Athenians were entirely
composed of intellectual or of active powers, and
they were drawn and held by the sweetest cords of
association. With Playfair, they attempted to go
quietly to the very depth of philosophic systems;
and anon, they started to the moon with Dr. Brewster.
While Leslie was new, they burned and
sweated with him in all the ardour of radiant
caloric; and now they lie upon mossy banks, prepared
for them by Brewster, Jamieson, and Sir
George, and listen to the tales of Sir Walter, or
to the ghost stories of Dr. Hibbert. Thus have
opinions changed, and importances have faded
away; but the Athenians have in their nature remained
the same. So change the phases of the
moon, now beamy, anon blank; now pushing her
horns eastward, now westward,&mdash;but still the same
dark globe, without light save that which it has at
second-hand from another.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">IF</span> there be nothing by which the Athens really
profits so much as her law, there is nothing of
which she is so ready, or so willing to boast, as her
literature. That is, as it were, her Benjamin&mdash;her
youngest-born child&mdash;the darling of her dotage, so
to speak; and it is loved and lauded in proportion
to the lateness of its appearance.</p>

<p>In the whole literature of Scotland there is, indeed,
a wonderful hiatus,&mdash;an interruption, for
which it would be impossible to account, if one
were not to look at her political and religious history.
Previous to the Reformation, the bards of
Scotland sung as sweetly, and her monks were as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
full and fabulous in their chronicles as those of any
other part of the world; and that dawn of intellect&mdash;that
day-spring of the mind, shone as warmly
and as well upon the bleak hills of Caledonia, as
upon the green pastures of more fertile lands.
The classical elegance, and the keen and searching
satire of Buchannan, the stern and stubborn eloquence
of Knox, and the polished but manly sentences
of Melville, will bear a comparison with any
thing that appeared contemporaneously in other
countries: but after them, there comes a dreary
and desolate blank; and while other nations are
rapidly running the career of knowledge, adding
book to book, and illustrious name to illustrious
name, Scotland appears not in the catalogue, except
in a manner which is even more melancholy
than if she appeared not at all. How is this to be
accounted for? In theory it would be impossible:
with the facts before one, it becomes the easiest
thing in the world.</p>

<p>No sooner had the morning of the Reformation
shone upon Scotland, than her horizon was obscured
by the clouds of civil war; and scarcely
were her men prepared for taking up the pen for
the information and amusement of their fellows,
when they were obliged to draw the sword for their
defence; and that energy which in happier times
would have trimmed the lamp of science, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
tuned the harp of song, was obliged to struggle
night and day, if so be that it could preserve but a
spark of liberty, or even keep the life. That despotism
and debauchery, which Mary the Regent
and Mary the Queen attempted, through their
French connexions, and by means of their French
mercenaries, to introduce into Scotland, was of
itself sufficient to render the intellectual improvement
of the country stationary for an age; and
though the resistance with which it met tended not
only to preserve but to strengthen the free spirit of
the people, it forbade the cultivation of the arts of
peace. The conduct of James, all shuffling and
pedantic as it was, did not, while he remained in
Scotland, tend to make matters improve; and upon
his removal to England, Scotland may be said to
have been given up to that delegated despotism of
influence, which, under various forms and names,
has continued to afflict her to the present day, and
must so continue till an uniformity of civil and
political law be established over the whole island.
From the beginning of the troubles under Charles,
to the Revolution in 1688, the state of Scotland
was such as to leave literature entirely out of the
question. The great body of the people&mdash;at least
of that part of them who otherwise might have
studied, or rewarded the study of literature, were
not only driven from all places congenial for literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
purposes, but even from the fastnesses of the
mountains, and the caves of the rocks; and though
a Scotchman was occasionally returning from foreign
parts to let his countrymen know what the
rest of the world were doing, terror and oppression
were too general for promoting any imitation. At
that time, too, one half the extent of Scotland was
in a state of the most abject ignorance: the feudal
law, in the Highlands, was in full exercise; and
when all the chiefs could not read, it was not to be
expected that there would be much taste for literature
among their vassals. Thus, it was not till the
termination of the second rebellion in favour of the
Stuarts, in 1745, that the people of Scotland generally
began to have a literary taste. A sure foundation
for such a taste had, indeed, been previously
laid, in the provision that within every parish in
Scotland there should not only be a school, but a
school so regulated as that the poorest, as well as
the most opulent, might reap the benefit of it; but
up to this period, and indeed for some time after,
the literature of those schools was confined to the
catechisms of the church and the reading of the
Bible; and if any literary work found its way into
a Scotch farm-house or cottage, if large, it was a
treatise on mystic or polemical divinity, and if
small, it was a legendary ballad, or a sermon by
some pious divine, whose style was not the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
classical, or his language the most easily understood.</p>

<p>It is not, indeed, fifty years since there was any
thing like a regular bookseller, or a printing-press
employed for literary purposes, in the Athens.
Before that time, there were persons who sold
Bibles, and catechisms, and ballads, and penny
almanacks, in divers nooks about Libberton Wynd
and the Lucken Booths; and there were printers
who, when a process before the Court of Session
became too voluminous, or when the parties could
not afford to pay for as many written copies as
were necessary, put the eloquence of the advocates,
and the wisdom of the judges, into types. An
occasional parson, too, would become so far enamoured
of his own powers of holding forth, as to
have a sermon, or homily, upon some question of
the catechism, or point of the confession of faith,
printed and published; but previous to the year
1780, it was very rare indeed to find an Athenian
bibliopole speculating in any literary work, the
price of which was to be more than sixpence; and
as for paying a man for literary labour, the Athenians
would as soon have thought of paying a
Lapland witch for procuring foul weather.</p>

<p>With regard to the literature of the Athens, it
is worthy of remark that the time of George the
Third corresponded with that of Anne in England;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and that when the style of writing south of the
Tweed was changing to another, if not to a better
model, the wits of the Athens were imitating the
Tatlers and Spectators.</p>

<p>The era of the French revolution was a remarkable
one in the literature, if not particularly of the
Athens, at least of the rest of Scotland; and the
reading of the pamphlets of that time, which probably
the people would have been as well without,
led to the establishment of subscription libraries
throughout the country, and made those readers,
and in some measure critics, in general literature,
whose whole course of study had previously been
theological. But until very recently, the periodical
literature of the Athens was hardly deserving the
name. The Athenian newspapers were always dull
and spiritless, and while the politics of the Athens
remain what they are, there is no chance that they
shall become better. In the provincial parts of
Scotland, I met with several journals written with
great taste, spirit, and liberality; but in the Athens,
there is only one worth naming,&mdash;the “Scotsman;”
and that, whether through fear of the party or
from what other cause, I know not, I found not to
be such as I would have expected. I found it a sensible
production, certainly, and as much superior to
the others as can well be imagined; but it is by no
means what would be expected from people pretending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to so much intellect, and freedom, as the
party by whom it was supported.</p>

<p>If the “Scotsman” had appeared in London, it
would not have produced almost any sensation. It
would have been allowed to take its place far down
in the list of weekly journals; but in the Athens,
I was told that it excited no small degree of alarm
among the official men. Just about that time, a
blow had been given to that bank influence by
which they had been in the habit of crushing every
opponent to their measures, whom they could not
get indicted and brought to trial; and this, together
with the strong and general feeling against
them that was at that time spread over the country,
and the appearance of a free journal, even at the
very seat of their power, which dared not merely to
dispute their principles, but even to expose their
practice, was enough to alarm those who were not
accustomed to any opposition, and whose hands
were understood to be not over and above clean.
When the early numbers of the “Scotsman” were
distributed over the city, spies were appointed to dog
the messengers, and take a note of those at whose
houses copies were delivered; and it was generally
believed that the lists were transcribed for the
edification both of the crown lawyers and of the
Athenian magistrates.</p>

<p>But the greatest and most extraordinary step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
that ever was taken in the periodical literature of
the Athens, or indeed of any country, was the appearance
of the Edinburgh Review,&mdash;a work, the
boldness, spirit, and originality of which were at
the time altogether unprecedented, and which never
yet have been, and probably never will be, equalled.
The Edinburgh Review was happy both in the
time and the manner of its appearance. Periodical
literature had been quite stagnant in the Athens
from the time of the Loungers and Mirrors; and
they had become too trifling for the awakened and
agitated spirit of the age. In London there were
some reviews, but the best of them were in the
hands of religious sectaries, who puzzled themselves
and plagued their readers with questions
which nobody could solve, and nobody would have
taken the trouble to solve, even if they could.
The whole of them were either tame or timid;
and folks continued to buy them rather with a view
of keeping their sets unbroken till chance should
introduce amendment, than from any desire to read
them. The war which had just terminated had
been expensive, and excepting those for whom
offices had been obtained, there was nobody with
whom it had ever been popular; and the war that
was beginning, or begun, had not much to recommend
it. There was, indeed, much to say against
the conduct of the Continental courts, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
against that of the English administration; people
were well prepared and anxious to hear it; and
there was no publication of the day of sufficient
interest in any way to divide or divert the attention.
The Review came like thunder; and to
give it the more effect, it came like thunder when
the air is still, and when men are listening.</p>

<p>Great, however, as was the talent displayed in
the Review, and wide and wonderful as was the
sensation which it produced upon its very first appearance,
the Athens had little merit in it, except
the mere name. The publisher, though he subsequently
rose as high in that trade as any English
publisher of the time, was then but a young man,
not much known, and not much recognised or
esteemed by the Athenians; the editor was also a
young man, recently returned from England; and
the most spirited contributors to the very early
numbers, had by no means had their minds
formed upon the Athenian model. The effect
which the Review produced was also not perhaps
so great in the Athens as in London; and it was
only when it had taken its place in the literary
world, and the acknowledgment of it was an honour,
that the Athenians began to identify it with
themselves, and at no time was the identification
general,&mdash;nor could the whole talent of the Athens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
even when in its best days, have supported the
Review for a single year.</p>

<p>Besides, though the real ability of the Edinburgh
Review was great, the vast popularity which it so
speedily obtained, and the brilliant course which
it ran, were unquestionably more owing to the
novelty of its plan, and the fact of its advocating
those political principles which were agreeable to
the majority of people at the time, than to its
merits.</p>

<p>One cause of the rise of the Edinburgh Review,
and perhaps also one cause of its comparative fall,
is the uniformity with which it has all along followed
the Whig party. Before that party got
into office, and when, in consequence of their boldness
and lofty pretensions as oppositionists, the
opinions of the Edinburgh Review,&mdash;at least, its
political opinions,&mdash;which were all along the ones
upon which the greater part of its celebrity rested,&mdash;were
by many received as the infallible oracles of
truth; and when the trial which the country had
had of that party shook them a little in public
estimation, though the Review received a shock
along with them, it still retained a considerable
portion of its influence. But, as the opinions of
men became a little more liberal, and the frequency
of disappointment made them more and more suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of all parties, some Jesuitical articles in the
Review, on the subjects of representation and reform,
shook the confidence of the people in it;
while, much about the same time, or, at least, not
long afterwards, the failure of its prophecies with
regard to the ultimate success of Buonaparte, laid
it open to the attacks of the Tories. For the first
of these suspicions, there appeared to be but too
much foundation; and though the latter was more
Jesuitical than just, still it was the interest of the
parties to press it to extremity. When the Edinburgh
Review predicted the ultimate triumph of
Napoleon, it did not, of course, anticipate, that he
would, with the example of Charles XII. before
him, undertake so hazardous an enterprise as a
winter campaign into the interior of Russia; but
the Review did not enter a caveat against such an
excursion; and, therefore, it was held as prophesying
in the face of this as well as of all the other
chances.</p>

<p>I have noticed those circumstances with a view
of showing, not only that the absolute literary
merits of the Edinburgh Review were not the sole
cause of its popularity, but that even though they
had, the merit does not in whole, or even in the
greater part, belong to the Athens. The Athens
never could, of her own will, ability, and patronage,
support a single literary man; and it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
not well be expected that she could, for any length
of time, support a literary work.</p>

<p>The first of these positions may be established
by a reference to the history of the whole literary
men of the Athens, as well as to the state which
they are in at the present time; and the second,
besides being a necessary and legitimate deduction
from the first, may be confirmed by an appeal to
the facts.</p>

<p>Allan Ramsay was the first Athenian writer,
after the hiatus of which I have spoken; and
Allan addressed himself as much to the taste and
foibles of the Athens as it was possible for one of
so limited education and limited powers to do.
Allan made a comfortable living; but he did not
make that as a poet; he did it, first, as a hairdresser,
and then as a bookseller, and as the
keeper of a circulating library, which, being the
first of the kind in the Athens, proved a most
fortunate speculation. The works of Colin Maclaurin,
and some of the other illustrious men, of
which the Athens never was worthy, were put into
circulation as much in the way of charity to their
families, as from any love for those sciences and
arts of which they were the ornaments.</p>

<p>Robert Ferguson was pre-eminently the poet of
the Athens. Born within her walls, he devoted
his muse to the chanting of her praises; and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
did she reward her tuneful son? Why, she blamed
him because he wrote verses rather than law papers;
she liked his songs, and she sung them;
but she would give him no reward for his labour;
and poor Ferguson, neglected, heart-broken, and
starved, ended his days in a mad-house; and his
ungrateful step-dame, the Athens,&mdash;that city,
which, if one would be silly enough to believe
her, is the model, the encourager, and the rewarder,
of all taste, would not do for him, what
England, even in her worst and most worthless
times, did for the poets whom she starved,&mdash;she
would not give him a monument,&mdash;no, not so much
as an unhewn stone, to let it be known that one
grave in the Canon-gate church-yard contained
holier dust than that of a baron bailie.</p>

<p>Even when the immortal Burns came, to shame
a selfish, undiscriminating, and ungrateful land,
the Athens made not the slightest attempt to wash
out the foul stain which she had given herself in
the case of Ferguson. Burns put her in mind of
that stain, not only by the erection of the little
tomb-stone over his unfortunate brother; but in
a monument more durable,&mdash;a poem, which, had
there been any soul within the cold ribs of the
Athens, would have harrowed it with remorse,
that might have been a stimulus to repentance.
But the Athens took it all with that sang-froid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
which is the concomitant and the characteristic of
reckless and self-sufficient dulness; and no where
in the whole history of literature, is there an instance
of neglect more mean, and ingratitude more
disgraceful, than that of the Athens, for Robert
Burns. She lured him, by fair promises, within
her siren and seductive walls. Day after day,
and week after week, she dipt him deeper in that
dissipation, of which she knows better how to set
the example than any city between Kent and
Caithness. She showed him about, from tavern to
tavern, from one evening party to another, and
through every one of her hundred scenes and sinks
of vice; and this precious work she continued, till
the prospects which he had left behind were blasted,
and his own powers and habits spoiled; and the
moment she had done this, she had the baseness,
not only to drive him helpless back upon the world,
but to slander his name for practices which none
but herself had taught him.</p>

<p>In a word, when I look at the literary men,
whom evil stars have confined to the Athens, or,
in any way made to look to her for patronage, I
find a few who have succeeded, because it has not
been in her power to injure them; and all upon
whom she has had power, lost and ruined. Even
Jeffrey, if he had not had his fees to bear him out,
and if his journal had not been patronised in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
might have written his Review in vain; ay,
and Scott, who perhaps persevered longer in
writing in obscurity than any other author of the
present times, would long ere now have been
mute or a maniac, had he not possessed some property,
held a public office, and been a fierce and
forward party-man. Among them all, there has
never been an author in the Athens who has lived
even decently by literature alone,&mdash;as little is there,
at this moment, within the whole of her compass,
a single person above starvation, who has not some
other occupation or emolument, than that of a literary
man.</p>

<p>The Edinburgh Review, the only periodical work
of any consequence in the Athens which professes
to be liberal, and which rests its character upon its
merits, and affords a revenue to any body, does
not support one literary man in the city, nor is
there one Athenian contributor to it, of whom
literature is the only or even the chief means of
support. Even the editor, well as it is alleged
he is paid for his labour, finds the wrangling of
the bar a more lucrative employment, addicts himself
more and more to it, and more and more withdraws
himself from the Review; while the place of
those Athenian writers of the higher class who
have died away, without being followed by successors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
worthy of them in their avowed professions,
are not replaced in the journal by Athenian writers
at all, but by mere hacks of London, who have
been so long upon the town that nobody sets much
store by their lucubrations.</p>

<p>The oldest literary journal in the Athens,&mdash;the
one which was once named after the whole of Scotland,
and which is now named peculiarly after the
Athens, is perhaps the one which should be taken
as the proper test of her literary powers.</p>

<p>Professing to be of no party in politics, but to set
forth the literature of the day in an independent
and gentleman-like style, and having the stamp of
hoary eld, and the connexion of the foremost bookseller
of the Athens to recommend and push it into
notice, one would suppose that the Edinburgh
Magazine would be elegant in its structure, and
extensive in its circulation. But it is neither the
one nor the other. When I was in the Athens,
the reputed editor was one of those miserable and
pretending quacks who can write nothing, and
whose taste and opinion are not worth a single
straw,&mdash;a fellow, who would indeed pretend to an
intimacy with the illustrious men both of England
and of Scotland, but who never, by any chance,
could have been in company with one of them;
and who had been appointed to this miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
editorship, because nobody who could write a
single page, or give a sensible opinion upon a
single book or subject, could be found, that would
have any thing to do with it.</p>

<p>The great success of the Edinburgh Review
tempted the cupidity of other booksellers; and, as
there was no possibility of contending with it in the
same class of writing, or on the same side of politics,
a journal of a novel description, not only in
the Athens, but in the world generally, was begun.
The celebrity of the Review, and the superiority
of the Whig advocates, had given a Whig bias,
at least as far as speech was concerned, to all the
young lawyers of any spirit and pretensions. To
so great a degree had this been carried, that even
the sons of the most super-ultra devotees to the existing
system spoke against sinecures, and hinted
that there were such things as the rights of the
people. Great alarm was the consequence; because
the holders of office found that they would
be spoiled of their honours and emoluments through
the liberality of their own children. The fear was,
no doubt, groundless; for had they taken themselves
as a test of patriotism, they would have
found that office and emolument are not things of
such feeble power. But they were alarmed, and
cast about to devise means for reclaiming the wandering
boys back to the good old and profitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
path. There was a sort of simultaneous movement
on the part of the boys themselves. They had
taken up the Whig song, just because it was the
popular one at the time; and they had looked for
a share of that public approbation and renown,
which had for a considerable time been bestowed
upon the more illustrious of the Whigs. But they
were disappointed: either they had made an undue
estimate of their own powers, or the demands
already established upon this approbation and renown
were as great as it could bear. Considering
the quarter whence these unnatural infants of place
came, they were probably suspected,&mdash;at any rate,
they were left for a few years, dancing attendance
at the heels of the Whigs, in a neglect more contemptuous
and complete than was wise in the one
party, or fair toward the other.</p>

<p>This happened just about the time when there
was a sort of movement against the Whigs on the
part of the Tories, and a sort of movement from
them on the part of the people. An appetite was,
in short, created, which called for food different
from the sapless husk of the Edinburgh Magazine,
and the hard and political fare of the Review.
Various causes conspired to give body to this appetite;
and Blackwood’s Magazine was the thing
produced. Still the party would not have had
courage actually to start that Magazine; for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
was a sort of belief afloat, that anybody, who would
venture to publish in the Athens that which was
not Whig, would fail, and anybody who would
attack the Whigs would be mauled for his pains.
The Magazine was started by very plain and unpretending&mdash;at
any rate, unwarlike Athenian men
of letters. They had a misunderstanding with
Blackwood; he got rid of them, and the Athens
began to taste the racy productions of the Tory
press. Even this cannot be reckoned an Athenian
production; for England and Ireland had to be
ransacked ere contributors could found, and even
yet, Blackwood, with the aid of his brother the
bailie, is editor.</p>

<p>When a sufficient number of those who, as was
supposed, would not be kept back either by moral
or by literary scruples, had been collected together,
the campaign was commenced. At first,
they seemed to have only two objects in view,&mdash;the
vilification of all persons who were supposed to
be either directly or indirectly connected with the
Whigs, more especially with the Edinburgh Review;
and a disposition to boast of their own debauchery,
immorality, and want of principle, in
order to disarm any one who might attack them
upon that ground.</p>

<p>Slander, especially if it be levelled against persons
whom the vulgar account it boldness to attack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and couched in careless and indifferent terms, is
always sure to please somebody; and, from what
I saw and heard, there are no people to whom it is
more agreeable than to certain parties in the Athens.
Accordingly, those opinions which, for half an age,
the people of the Athens had been taught to receive,
without so much as questioning their soundness,
were turned into burlesque and ribaldry; and
those persons to whom they had been accustomed
to look up with respect and veneration, were ridiculed
and abused. As those opinions and those
persons were alike obnoxious to the ruling faction
in the Athens&mdash;though that faction had never ventured
to express its dislike&mdash;they received the new
style of writing with no common degree of delight
and gratitude. Themselves and their cause had
been so long and so severely cudgelled and exposed,
that they had given up all hopes of having
any thing said in their favour. Therefore, they
regarded the productions of those, who took up that
line of conduct merely because it was the only one
in which they had even a chance of success, as
hearty and devoted champions; and the writers,
finding that they met with more patronage, and
patronage which promised to lead to more advantageous
results than they had calculated, became
more and more decidedly partisans, and waxed more
bold and barefaced in their attacks. A coarse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
clumsy imitation of the biblical style, which would
have passed unnoticed, but for its local applications,
and its gross personality, gave very general
offence, and for that reason procured them a notoriety
which otherwise they would probably never
have obtained; and some cruel insinuations against
a venerable personage whom the whole country had
looked up to as a model, both of a man and of a
philosopher, were believed to give him so much
pain, when the decay of nature had all but put an
end to a long career of usefulness and celebrity,
that they fancied no one was too low or too high
for feeling their attacks.</p>

<p>It must be allowed that both novelty and talent
were displayed in those productions,&mdash;at least in
some of them. The style and manner were altogether
new: a sort of virgin-soil, as it were, had
been turned up for culture; and though by far the
greater portion of its produce was weeds, and
weeds too of the rankest description, yet they had
all the vigour and greenness of a first crop. Periodical
writing had for a long time consisted
of abstract disquisitions, or tales which had no decided
locality, or connexion with individual and
existing character; and whatever may have been
the practices of the writers, they kept up a regular
show of sobriety and morality in their writings.
But the writers of Blackwood’s Journal not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
seasoned their productions with unsparing personality,
but affected to be adepts in debauchery, and
pretended to keep no secrets from their readers,
even in the most unseemly of their carousals.
Having manufactured ideal names and characters
for themselves, they treated these in the most unceremonious
manner; and this, in some measure,
took off the edge of that indignation which otherwise
would have been felt at their treatment of real
characters. More than any thing, they succeeded;
and success is generally received as the test not
only of ability, but of a good cause, in literature
as well as in war. If Blackwood’s Magazine had
never got into considerable circulation, the writers
in it would have been regarded as miserable and
malicious rebels from the honest cause of literature;
but as they were in so far successful, they
obtained in some degree the renown of heroes.</p>

<p>Among those writers there were, unquestionably,
some of talents far superior to what may be supposed
the average of those who contribute to ordinary
magazines; and though these for a time took
part in the ribald practices of the publication, and
were pleased for a season with that eclât which
such practices are supposed to afford; yet still, new
in what might be considered as the most blamable
perversions of their talents, there were gleams of a
better spirit, and promises that they could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
always follow the same course. That some of the
best of them have already done so, is apparent
from the altered spirit of the later numbers, in
which there is an attempt at the same external appearance,
but a visible paucity in spirit; and the
probability is that, ere long, Blackwood’s Magazine,
which has always had a considerable portion
of its articles from London, will gradually derive
its supplies more and more from that quarter, or
dwindle to the same inanity as its monthly brother
of the Athens.</p>

<p>Indeed, the whole tenor of Blackwood is of a
description which cannot be permanent. It offers
no principle upon which the mind of an unprejudiced
and independent man can dwell at the time,
and as little to which any body can refer afterwards
for the purpose of obtaining information. Personality,
if bold, daring,&mdash;or, to use one of its own
terms, <i>blackguard</i> enough, is sure to make a noise
at the time; but its interest is short in proportion
to its intensity. For the philosophic discussion of
any one subject, for the establishing of any one
principle in science, in morals, or in politics, or for
any one addition to the stock of human information,
it is in vain to look back at the book; and
though people talk about it (and they talk less and
less about every successive number,) at the period
of its appearance, it may be supposed to pass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
necessity into the same speedy oblivion as the animosities
or whims by which it was produced; and
that future men will have no more desire to know
how written slander was managed in the days
of Blackwood, than they have at present to know
in what terms the ladies of Billingsgate rated each
other when the Tower of London was a seat of
royalty.</p>

<p>Some may indeed suppose, that as this species of
writing is not kept back by any inflexibility of
principle from bending round all the sinuosities,
and accommodating itself to all the crooked paths
of corruption, it will continue to find enough of
support from the official men of the Athens, and
their coadjutors and underlings throughout Scotland;
this, however, is by no means the case.
Those persons have no love for literature of any
description: their deeds are such as will not bear
any kind of light, and the whole of their hopes are
centred in the one circumstance of the public’s
being kept in ignorance of what they are doing.
Like criminals under trial, their only chance is in
an attempt to shake the credibility of the witnesses
against them; and if they attempt a direct defence
of themselves, it is sure to render their offences
more palpable, and their condemnation more certain.
So long as public opinion remains, and the
whole appearances of the times give promise that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
will continue to gather strength rather than to
decay&mdash;it is a tribunal to which none but those
who have a wish to stand well with the public
will be disposed to appeal; and therefore, how
much soever the official men of the Athens may
have been gratified by the attempts which the
writers in Blackwood have made to traduce their
political opponents, and turn them into ridicule,
there is nothing at which they would be so much
alarmed, or indeed have so much cause to be
alarmed, as an attempt at their own justification,
even in the same pages. As long as such writers
as those in Blackwood confine themselves to personal
attacks in the offensive way, so long will they
not be dreaded or disliked by that party of which
they endeavour to hold themselves out as the
champions; but the moment that they depart from
this offensive mode of personal warfare, and take a
single position upon the real ground in dispute,
from that moment the whole of their batteries,
whether they will or not, must be turned against
those whom they affect to defend. Thus, though
they may have been useful in effecting a momentary
distraction of public attention, they neither
have, nor can they overturn a single principle of
those against whom their ribaldry is directed, nor
establish one for those whom they call their friends.</p>

<p>There is another thing against their permanence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Men, whether official or not, are never fond of
having that brought prominently forward in which
themselves do not excel. Now if one were to pitch
upon the very weakest point&mdash;the blank as it were
in the official men of Scotland, and of the Athens,
that upon which one would pitch would be literature.
The civic part of them, from their education,
their associates, and the whole tenour of their
lives, can neither love a book, nor, indeed, know
any thing about it; and if the opposition and
liberal men of the Athens, who after all are by
very much the majority, are utterly unable or unwilling
to support even one literary man, it is not
to be supposed that the other party who are fewer
in number, and ever fearful of exposure, can have
more ability or more disposition. No doubt, such
of the writers for Blackwood as know the extreme
barrenness of the ruling men in the Athens, in all
matters of taste and information, and the more
fond and forcible predilection which they have for
dining in taverns and carousing in ale-houses, and
who have marked that those ears which are deaf as
their kindred clay to every voice of elegance or of
criticism, are open as their mouths for a dinner, or
their hands for a bribe, when grossness usurps the
place of taste, and ribaldry comes in the stead of
science,&mdash;no doubt those writers have risked a
hope in supplying husks for the Athenian swine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
but though the deeds have been immoral, the remembrance
of them will not be immortal; and
though there may always be a few that, seeking
their chief pleasure, and finding their only renown
in their own debauchery, are pleased to see deeds
worthless as their own,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Register’d to fame eternal,<br />In deathless pages of diurnal;”</p>

<p class="pn1">Yet even this would not have succeeded with
the public generally, at any period, and it perhaps
could have had less chance at no period than it has
at present, when the rapid spread of intercourse
and information is, in spite of all official and other
efforts to the contrary, diffusing a more rational
taste even down to the very humblest classes of
society. Men in office, however inferior and second-rate
that office may be, and however mean
may be their own tastes, and grovelling their own
habits, will not&mdash;dare not, continue long to pride
themselves in, or even privately to encourage, that
from which the peasantry turn away in disgust;
and, ere many additional years have been added to
the Kalendar, it will be found that those superior
spirits who lent themselves to this work for a
time, in the hope that it would serve them as a
stepping-stone for getting into office, will become
ashamed of it in consequence of having obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
their objects, or disgusted, because that which they
must have felt as a degradation, has to them, also,
proved a deception.</p>

<p>But, whatever of good or of evil, of liveliness or
of licentiousness, of the misapplication of talent,
or the miserable labour of that which is no talent
at all, may be found in the school of writing, of
which Blackwood’s Magazine hitherto forms the
chief specimen, the Athens assuredly has neither
the merit nor the demerit of originating that
school; and if all support, except what the
Athens could give it, were to be withdrawn, the
remainder of its existence would not exceed one
month.</p>

<p>Having heard a great deal about the intellectuality
of the Athens, and its superiority in genius,
in taste, and in literature, above every other city
in the world, I made a point of examining, with
all the care and candour that I could exercise.
I began too, with a strong, yes, a very strong prejudice
in its favour; for it had been rung again and
again in my ears, that, compared with what was to
be found here, the whole world beside was an empire
of dulness. But my fond, and as it proved to
be my foolish prejudice, became less and less, at
every step; and, whether I would or not, I was
compelled to see, that the greater part of the name
which somehow or other the Athens has gotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
has been gotten through the unceasing brazen-frontedness
of her own self-idolatry. In various
parts of the Athens, I found men <i>pirouetting</i> in
small evolutions of what they call philosophy.
One, for instance, worshipping the wings of a butterfly;
and another drawing lines and circles upon
a human skull, and measuring the talents and propensities
of the unknown owner very gravely with
a pair of compasses and scale; a third, taking up
the visions of Robert Owen of New Lanark, was
bewildering himself in an attempt so to arrange the
human race, as that the square of the oblique
diagonal of conduct should be equal to the two
squares of the base of nature, and the perpendicular
of education; a fourth was proving by coal
and limestone, that the globe had been boiled;
and a fifth, by porphyry and basalt, that it had
been roasted. One learned professor, the very apex
of the triangle of the Athenian science,&mdash;who, in his
time, has tested hell, as it were&mdash;has, in the ardour
of his inquiries after and into things hot and cold,
alternately deputed his</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;“delighted spirit<br />
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside<br />
In thrilling regions of the thick-ribb’d ice,”&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn1">was reported to me, (for I did not <i>then</i> see him,)
not exactly</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“To be imprisoned in the viewless wind,<br />
And blown with restless violence round about<br />
The pendent world,”</p>

<p class="pn1">but to have made one of the most singular experiments
upon the said winds themselves, that ever
entered into a philosophic head. This learned personage,
whom the Athenian magistrates had at
one time refused to expel from the city “<i>cum avisamento
eorum ministrorum</i>,” upon the alleged
ground of his being a conjuror, had made long
and laborious experiments in all sorts of heating
and cooling, physical and metaphysical. When
other matters and fires were nearly exhausted with
him, it struck him that it would excite mortal
wonder, and win immortal renown, if he could
bring atmospheric air to a red heat. He foresaw,
that if he should succeed in this experiment, it
would be farewell to both gas and steam; and
there would be no need of dangerous boilers, castiron
pipes, smoking chimneys, and all the other
casualties of the new power and the new light. If
this degree of temperature could be communicated
to the atmosphere, the fondest dreams of mankind
would be realized,&mdash;the midnight air might
be rendered more glorious than the sun; winter
might be driven within the polar circle; the
precinct of the Holyrood might be made fragrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
with spices, and fat with olives; and the vine might
clothe the now naked crags, green with never-fading
leaves, and purple with perennial grapes.
That which promised so many and so delightful
advantages was worth trying, and so the philosophic
personage is reported to have gone about his
experiment in this wise:&mdash;</p>

<p>He procured a bagpipe; and having dissected
away the chanter, the drones, and the bellows,&mdash;making
the stumps secure with ligatures, he
carried the inflated bag to a neighbouring barn,
and set two brawny peasants a-threshing it with
their flails, while he stood by, wishing and wondering
as to the result. What that result was, I
was unable to learn, and indeed I made not much
inquiry respecting it,&mdash;and I mention it only as
one of the many instances in which I heard the
Athenians boast of their philosophy.</p>

<p>But if they have no literary men, as such, of
whom they can boast, they have about as little
title to put on airs about their literary taste. In
that, as well as in all other matters, they are
idolaters; and it may be truly said of them, as
was said of the people of the elder Athens, that
the most conspicuous of their altars is “to the
Unknown God.” So long as Jeffrey was deemed
infallible, they ventured no opinion upon any
point, until they knew how he had delivered himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
When, for instance, he had, as he thought,
blasted the laurels of Byron in the bud, the cry
that ran through the Athens was, “What a silly
fool to attempt to write poetry? But the Review has
done his business. <i>He</i> will write no more at any
rate.” When the retribution of the “Scotch Reviewers”
was hurled back, the worshippers of the
Athens were astonished, but they said nothing.
The fact is, that they neither have opinions of
their own in such matters, nor have they leisure to
form them.</p>

<p>The observations which I had occasion to make
respecting the dramatic taste of the Athenians are
equally applicable to their taste, not only in literature,
but in every thing else. In youth their education
is too superficial, and when they grow up, the
drudgery of the law, to which so many of them are
doomed, and which influences the habits of the whole,
together with that dissipation in which they indulge
as habitually and more deeply than any people with
whom I am acquainted, give a turn to their minds
which is the very opposite of literary. These causes
will be more fully developed in the following chapter;
but there is one fact which is very remarkable,
which the Athenians themselves may as well be left
to explain. Of the men who, from time to time,
have become illustrious in the Athens for their scientific
or literary attainments, hardly one has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
born, and very few have been educated, within her
walls. They have almost uniformly been provincial
Scotchmen, and not a few of them have been students
at the provincial universities. So that while
the Athens has not much to boast of in the literary
way, the little of which she can boast is not wholly
her own. Perhaps this is another of the desolations
of the widowed metropolis.</p>

<p class="pc reduct">Just as the twig is bent the tree’s inclined.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p>

<hr class="d6" />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">IF</span> there be one cause to which, more than others,
we are to look for an explanation of those peculiarities
that distinguish the inhabitants of one place
from the inhabitants of others, that cause is education.
I do not mean that education which is given,
or attempted to be given, at schools and colleges,
but that which is produced by the contact and collision
of those with whom young men associate at
that important period when they are beginning to
think and to act for themselves. There is no doubt
that more of the character of society in the Athens
depends upon this circumstance than upon any
thing else, as, so far as my observation extended,
there is more peculiarity in the treatment of the
Athenian youth at this period than in any other
city of the British empire.</p>

<p>It is to this education, for life and not for literature,
which I mean chiefly to advert in this chapter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Still, it may not be amiss to give a preliminary
glance at the school education, not of the Athens
merely, but of Scotland generally, because on that,
it strikes me, Englishmen might find something
both to learn and to imitate. The idea of having
one or more schools in each parish, so established
that no teacher can be appointed to them who is
not well educated, and so endowed that they can
never be corrupted as the free-schools so frequently
are in England, or confined to the most opulent
classes of society, as the better class of schools are
in that country, is one of the best that ever entered
into the imagination of any legislature. Even
in the remotest and most thinly-inhabited parish of
Scotland, the schoolmaster is a man of real information:
not unfrequently the son of humble parents,
who, finding that he evinced talents and a taste for
learning, sent him to school, and to some one or
other of those cheap universities in Scotland, where,
judging from the number of illustrious names that
they can boast of, learning is nothing the worse for
its cheapness, till he was qualified for orders; but
who, finding his influence insufficient for procuring
him the ease and indolence of a parsonage, took, as
his only alternative, the humbler and more laborious,
but unquestionably more useful, office of parish
schoolmaster. Young men of this description are
one of the greatest blessings that a country can possess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and rather than that Scotland should lose them,
it were more for her welfare that all the boasted
philosophy, and all the brawling law of the Athens
were at the bottom of the sea. They may be said
not only to pursue learning for its own sake, and
without any view either to honour or emolument,
but also to follow the profession of teachers from
the same disinterested motives. Since professions
more lofty and lucrative than that of minister of the
Scotch Kirk monopolized the sons of the wealthier
Scotch&mdash;since the free sons of the mountains went
to practise slavery in the west, and those of the
plains to get wealth and liver complaints in the east,
the ecclesiastical offices in Scotland have been almost
exclusively filled by the sons of the poor. These
almost invariably pass a part of their early life either
as parochial schoolmasters or as tutors in private
families. The tutors are those who have the best
connexion, the most ambition, and the most fawning
and obsequious habits. They are menial servants,
and with the education of gentlemen they are
sent to companion with butlers and valets, to humour
the caprices of wayward children, and to
hear the fooleries of booby “lairds,” and the scorn
of assuming dames, who can see no merit but in
being connected with this, that, or the other family,
which has borne the same name, and inhabited the
same lands since the first introduction of crows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
cow-stealing. Connected with this office, at least
in the majority of instances, there are humiliations
to which no lad of spirit would submit for the sake
of the present emolument. The hope, and generally
the stipulation, of the tutor is, that his patron
shall, when he has drudged and degraded himself
for the requisite number of years, “bless him
with a kirk;” and this abasement,&mdash;this bowing
down before the patron, in order that they may, in
due time, rise to the living, is one of the chief reasons
why the Scotch parsons have swerved from
that independence of feeling and of action, of which
the example was set them by John Knox, and become
as willing and obsequious worshippers at the
feet even of delegated power, or of unmerited place,
as imagination can picture to itself. If it were not
that they are strained through this filter, we should
never have had them declaring, ex cathedrâ, that the
National Monument, a piece of gratuitous foolery,
or vanity, or political patchwork, was “a most
suitable and appropriate expression of gratitude to
the Lord of Hosts.” If they had not been studying
somewhere else than in their bibles, their answer
would have been&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Being, whom we profess to worship, and
under whose protection we certainly are, cannot be
propitiated by votive offerings of stone and lime;
and the gallant deeds of our brave countrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
however gracefully they might be chiselled on the
frieze of the ‘restored Parthenon,’ could not, in
the slightest degree, redound to his glory, although
they might, to a certain extent, flatter the vanity
of men. The offerings which He requires are not
swelling columns and fretted architraves: they
are <i>deeds</i>&mdash;deeds of justice, beneficence, and mercy,
done to our fellow men. After He has enumerated
the most costly and splendid sacrifices-just for the
purpose of declaring that in his sight they avail
nothing&mdash;He delivers this simple but heavenly commandment,
‘Offer to God <i>thanksgiving</i>.’ To propose
the erection of <i>any edifice</i>, therefore, as ‘a
most suitable and appropriate expression of gratitude
to the Lord of Hosts,’ savours little of the
knowledge and still less of the spirit of Christianity;
and if no edifice whatever could be such an expression,
far less could a temple which had been erected
for the worship of dead and useless idols.”</p>

<p>The filtration, or winnowing, or whatever process
it may be called, which has separated and set
apart the more flexible portion of the educated peasantry
of Scotland for the peculiar service of the
kirk, has been in an eminent degree favourable for
the schools, which have thus reserved to them the
most independent and generally also the most enthusiastically
devoted to learning.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned ere now, that the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
who fill learned situations, or are engaged in literary
pursuits in Scotland, ought, in genius, though
perhaps not always in education, to be superior to
men of the same description in England; for the
expense of obtaining any thing like a literary education
in the latter country is so great, and the disposition
to obtain it is so contrary to the habits of the
humbler, and even the middle ranks of the people,
that the range of classes from whom the learned
men of England can be taken, is far narrower than
that from which Scotland can make her election.
In England, a peasant or a small farmer never so
much as dreams of giving his son a classical or a
university education; and even among the wealthier
yeomen and tradesmen this is seldom done, except
with an immediate view to a church living, to which
if the person so educated should not succeed, he
returns back to the counter or the counting-house.</p>

<p>In Scotland, again, though the gates, at least of
some species of knowledge, do not stand open so
widely or so long as in England, yet they stand
open to every class of the people; and thus, though
the population of Scotland be not one-sixth part of
that of England, the number of persons from whom
the learned men of Scotland are chosen is perhaps
greater; indeed, it is positively greater, for the
whole two millions of the Scotch people are in this
situation; and if all the classes in England who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the power and the will to educate their children be
counted, they will be found far fewer than this.
Now, as the means of obtaining liberal education
descend in society, the quantity of talent must necessarily
increase. In natural ability, a hundred
peasants, at least a hundred peasant boys, are not
necessarily inferior to the same number of scions of
nobility; and as the total number of peasants exceeds
the total numbers of the others, the whole
quantity of natural capacity must be greater. Whatever,
indeed, may be their differences after they
grow up, and when all the varieties of advantage,
opportunity, and habit have come into play, it cannot
be denied that there is a point in the age of all
classes of society at which their talents and capacities
are in the precise ratio of their numbers; and
it is equally true that, if they were all taken at this
point, and subjected to the same discipline, the
number of illustrious men that would be obtained
from each class would also be in the precise ratio
of the total number. But all classes in Scotland
have, from infancy up to a certain period, the same
facilities of being educated, and therefore, in obtaining
a supply of learned and literary men, Scotland
has the choice of the whole population.</p>

<p>But this is not the only advantage that results
from throwing the gates of knowledge open to all the
people, for those of the poorer classes who are sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to college have a chance of possessing greater natural
abilities, and being more assiduous and successful
in the cultivation of them, than those who
are sent from the rich.</p>

<p>This may, at first sight, appear to be paradoxical,
but its truth will become apparent upon very little
reflection. The more seductive pleasures of youth
to which the rich have access, are, independently
of any other cause, sufficient to turn the scale in favour
of the poor. To the rich, the hours spent in
the prosecution of knowledge are hours taken from
the enjoyment of pleasure, and as such they must
ever be looked upon as a task and a drudgery. To
the poor, on the other hand, the hours spent in the
prosecution of knowledge are an abridgment of
labour more irksome and severe, and therefore they
must ever be regarded as relaxation and pleasure.
Besides, the children of the rich are sent to college,
not so much with a view to the perfection of education
in the meantime, and the profitable application
of it afterwards, as because it is the custom, or that
their parents and guardians can afford the expense.
The pupil who is born to wealth or to honours, considers
his literary attainments not only as a merely subordinate
accomplishment, but as one which stands in
the way of others that he deems more consistent
with his rank, and feels to be more consonant with
his desires; while he to whom the same pursuit is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
present pleasure, and the hoped foundation of future
honour and emolument, is certain not only to like
it better, but to pursue it with more zeal and success.
Of the illustrious names that have been famed
in the pages of Scotch biography, a far greater proportion
have sprung from humble life than are to
be found in the annals of any other country. The
fact is, that although the Scotch peasants have a
strong desire to educate all their children, it is only
the ones who are believed or found to possess a superior
degree of genius that are educated for literature;
and of the discoveries of original genius
that are continually making in the provincial parts
of Scotland a very curious book might be made. I
shall mention one instance of the many:</p>

<p>The gentleman, who at this moment takes the
highest station among the philosophers of the Athens,
and who would have been entitled to no mean place
even when her philosophy was in the zenith of its
splendour, is of humble though highly respectable
extraction. His father rented a small farm in the
kingdom of Fife, and had it not been that accident
revealed the genius of the infant philosopher, first
to the village parson, next through his advice to
learned professors of St. Andrew’s, and, lastly,
through the wisdom of that advice, to the world at
large, his experiments might have been confined to
composts for the fields, instead of compositions for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the furtherance of science; and his speculations,
instead of grasping the globes of the earth and the
heavens, might never have soared above a globe-turnip.
That the loss that science would thus have
sustained would have been great, even the enemies
of the philosopher (and there is no philosopher
without enemies, especially in the Athens) must
allow; for the lines of his discovery have not only
been boldly drawn, but have been drawn in situations
which no other philosopher has attempted. If,
therefore, the discovery which I am about to relate,
singular as those who are not conversant with the
modes in which genius, when left to itself, developes
itself, may consider it to be, had not been made, a
blank page would have remained in the book of
knowledge, which is now full and fair in its characters
of wisdom. The future philosopher, as was
once the case with nearly all the nascent philosophers
of Scotland, and may still be the case with a
few, not the worst of them, divided the year between
the study of learning, and the observation of
nature. When winter had spoiled the fields of their
beauty, and driven the shepherds and cow-herds
into the villages, he went to school, where the Proverbs
of Solomon, Ruddiman’s Rudiments of the
Latin Tongue, and Dilworth’s Arithmetic, by turns
expanded his wisdom, or perplexed his ingenuity;
and when the fields were again in flower and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
birds in song, he was sent forth to observe the progress
of vegetable and animal life, notice the revolutions
of suns, and feel the practical philosophy of
wind and rain. In order that there might be economy
as well as information in his employment during
the latter season, he was enjoined to attend to
the movements of his father’s cows, as well as to
those of nature; and until he had reached nearly
the end of his twelfth year, it remained doubtful
whether cattle or causation was to be the future
business and glory of his life. In the summer of
that year, however, the die was cast, and never was
turning-up more philosophically fortunate, or more
fortunate for philosophy. In one of those village
libraries, which often contained more rich variety of
lore than is to be found among the countless volumes
of even an Athenian repository of books, he had
found a thumbed and boardless copy of Simpson’s
Euclid, which might in its time have perplexed the
wits of ten successive classes at St. Andrew’s. By
that strong intuition which ever characterizes superior
genius, even at its earliest dawn, he found out
that this was a volume worthy of being read, and
throwing aside the Shorter Catechism of the Kirk,
which had been furnished him by his parents for
his recreation, as well as the exploits of George Buchannan,
the History of Buckhaven, the exquisite
biography of Paddy from Cork, and the sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
songs of Sir James the Rose, and the Laird of Coull’s
Ghost, with which he had contrived to furnish himself,
he set fondly and furiously to work upon
Simpson’s Euclid, preparing his floor, and drawing
his diagrams in the same manner, though not exactly
in the same materials, as the philosophers of
antiquity. The smooth grassy sod answered all
the purposes of the abacus, and the cows generously
supplied him in a substitute for the sand. Spreading
and smoothing that substitute with his bare
foot, he engraved upon it with his finger the mystic
lines and letters; and, with book in hand, proceeded
to establish the elementary principles of geometry,
heedless though the cows should, in the mean time,
scale the fence, and carry the neighbouring corn by
a <i>coupe de la bouche</i>.</p>

<p>One day as he was occupied in this learned work,
the parson of the village happened to be on the
other side of the hedge, pacing backwards and forwards,
and cudgelling his reluctant and retentive
brains for as much of the raw material of sermonizing
as would serve to put him and his parishioners
over the ensuing Sunday. While he paced and
pleaded with the sluggish spirit, his ear was assailed
by a continued <i>mumbling</i> of voice through the
hedge, which caught so much stronger a hold of
him than he could do of his sermon, that his steps
and his study were both brought to a dead stand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and his outward ears perked up in the fondest attitude
of listening. Ministers as well as men often
remember the words of that of which they were
never able to grapple with the meaning; and thus,
though the old parson did not exactly comprehend
the extent of that proposition, the diagram of which
the young philosopher had traced upon his soft
abacus, and the demonstration of which he was rehearsing
in very solemn tones, yet he remembered
that such words had been used by one of the professors
in that part of his academic course which
he had never understood. That which is known is
always simple, and that which is not known, however
simple it may be in itself, is always accounted
the very depth of wisdom. The parson was astonished,
and, for a moment, he doubted the evidence
of those ears upon which he had had to depend
through a long life. He tried the one, it caught,
“The angles at the base of an isosceles triangle;”
he tried the other, it continued the enunciation,
“are equal to one another.” He poked his head
half way through the hedge, and the auxiliary testimony
of his eyes and spectacles confirmed that of
his ears. He saw the abacus, the book, and the
student, and forthwith descended to the village, big
and puffing with the tale. A visit from the parson
at any other hour than that of dinner, is always an
ominous matter to some of the family of a Scotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
peasant. If the young folks be children they dread
the catechism. If more advanced, there are occasional
terrors of that Scotch tread-mill, which is
trodden alone and in presence of the assembled
congregation. The mother of the philosopher had
nothing to dread upon either of those grounds,
but still she felt all the glow of a woman’s curiosity,
when the parson approached her husband with so
hasty steps and so important looks.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Lascelles,” said the parson, “you
must take care of Jock, and that forthwith, for I
am thinking that he is a <i>genus</i>.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to hear it, Sir,” replied Mr.
Lascelles, lifting his bonnet, “but he is very
young, and will get steadier as he grows up. Has
he been letting the cows eat your corn?”</p>

<p>“The Lord forbid either the one thing or the
other,” said the parson. “He is a genus, a mathematical
genus, and will be an honour to the
parish when we are both dead and gone.”</p>

<p>The father now understood that the words which
he had at first considered as lamentation were laudatory;
the fatted calf was killed, the parson was
feasted, the boy taken from the cows, and sent to
college; and the result is&mdash;a perfect Anak in philosophy.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>That the literary men of Scotland are drawn
from the whole range of the population is not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
in favour of themselves; it is also highly advantageous
to the humbler classes of the people. In as
far, indeed, as merely literary men are concerned,
the advantage to Scotland is by no means great,
because in Scotland they meet with but little reward
to stimulate their exertions. And hence they
are obliged to scatter themselves over the world.
But still, the number that remain, and fill the duties
of parochial and other teachers throughout the
country, are superior, not in degree merely, but
absolutely in kind, to the teachers of youth, more
especially youth of the poorer classes, in any other
part of the country. In England, for instance,
when a man of general information undertakes the
office of teacher, he does it either with the hope of
making a fortune by teaching the children of the
rich, or as a matter of necessity, and as a dernier
resort after having been unfortunate in teaching
the children of the poor. But one who is to have
any chance of succeeding in the communication of
any thing else than the mere mechanism of reading,
writing, and casting accounts, which after all does
not deserve the name of education, must love his
profession for its own sake, and look upon the exercise
of it as an honour,&mdash;which, in one that instructs
the children of the lower orders, can never
be the case, unless he himself has been educated as
one of those orders. It is quite natural, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
is also quite true, that the education which is most
beneficial for any one class of society, can neither
be imparted nor purchased by any other class.
Charity schools will never be held in much estimation
by any one who has seen the progress of those
poor children for whose education their own parents
pay. There is something in the receiving of any
kind of charity which is humiliating and debasing;
and to bestow a charitable education upon the
whole or the greater part of the labouring classes
in the country, would be the surest means not only
of leaving them nearly uneducated, but of destroying
their virtue and diminishing their usefulness.</p>

<p>It is to the absence of this humiliating mode of
being instructed, and the presence of one infinitely
better and more rational, that the grand peculiarity
of the Athens, and remarkably of the provincial parts
of Scotland, is chiefly to be attributed. The smallness
of Scotch and even of Athenian society, the
limited number even of the labouring classes, who,
except in Glasgow, and perhaps a place or two
more, are all intimately known, as well in their
connexions as in their individual characters, and
perhaps also the low rate of wages, and the fewer
facilities to solitary dissipation, may no doubt account
for some portion of the intelligence and
virtue of the humbler Scotch. But still, in as far
as those circumstances operate, they must operate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
upon the higher classes as well as the lower; and,
as the higher classes in Scotland have no such
superiority over the higher classes in other countries,
as the lower have over the lower, there must
be some special cause which operates in favour of
the Scotch peasantry. I have looked round for
causes; I have found none except those remarkable
advantages in respect of teachers of education,
(unless, perhaps, it be that the sober and simple
Kirk of Scotland has a more wholesome influence
upon the poor than a more showy and aristocratical
establishment can exert,) and I think I discovered
that those advantages are quite sufficient to account
for the fact.</p>

<p>If there were not something in education that
made strongly and peculiarly in favour of the
Scotch peasantry, why should they be decidedly
before the peasantry of England, both in talent and
civilization, while not merely the upper ranks of
the provincial Scotch, but even the learned and
official scribes (and pharisees) of the Athens, are so
markedly and so monstrously behind? This circumstance,
unaccustomed as kings may well be
supposed to be to rigorous philosophic observation,
did not escape the notice of George the Fourth.
He expressed no unusual admiration at the polish
of the Scotch peers, the elegance of the Scotch
ladies, the learning of the Scotch professors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
parsons, or the worshipful appearance of the Scotch
magistrates; but the Scotch people, the crowds
who shouted his welcome on his arrival, and who
cheered him every time he appeared in public,
were a source of wonder and a theme for admiration,&mdash;and
a proof, against which there is no arguing,
that if people receive the education of gentlemen,
their habits will correspond, however scanty
their earnings or scanty their abodes.</p>

<p>In the Athens, this relative superiority of the
humbler classes over those whom chance, ancestry,
or office has set up into the high places, is not only
more remarkable than in any other locality that I
ever visited, but the most remarkable, at least the
most admirable feature in the character of the
Athens herself.</p>

<p>I have said, and I dare themselves to deny it, that
her men in office are a trifling and a truckling race;
I have said, and I dare themselves to deny it, that
a great mass of her scribes unite some of the worst
propensities of the Jew, with none of the best of
the attorney; I have said, and I dare them to
deny it, that her schools of philosophy have “fallen
into the sear and yellow leaf,” and that her philosophical
societies pursue trifles from which even
school-boys would turn with disdain; and I have
said, that her <i>gentry</i> have neither the capacity nor
the means of encouraging the sciences, literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and the fine arts; but though I have said thus,
and said it from personal&mdash;perhaps painful, observation,
I am bound to add, that in point of intellect,
and all matters considered in point of conduct,
the populace of the Athens are far superior to any
with which I am acquainted. When I visited the
public libraries, the men whom I found borrowing
the classical and philosophical books wore aprons,
while the occasional lady or gentleman that I saw
there, was satisfied with the romance of the week,
or the pamphlet of the day.</p>

<p>This accumulation of intellect among the lower
and labouring classes is a delightful thing,&mdash;when
contemplated as studying history or philosophy, or
sporting itself with the finest productions of genius.
In this calmness and tranquillity it puts one in
mind of the blue expanse of the interminable and
unfathomable ocean; its immensity makes you feel
it sublime; its depth tints it with that transparent
green which the eye never wearies in contemplating,&mdash;but,
when the wind is up, when the billows
heave their masses, dash their spray to the heavens,
and deafen the ends of the earth with their roar,
the ocean becomes a fearful and a formidable thing;
and, when the winds of oppression chafe it, so is a
population so learned, and so linked together, as
the labouring classes of the Athens.</p>

<p>In the great manufacturing or commercial towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of England, and even, and perhaps to fully as great
a degree, in the British metropolis, one finds the
labourers and operative mechanics, though strong
enough at their labour, and skilful enough at their
craft, far down indeed in the intellectual scale,&mdash;reduced
from their want of emulation to seek their
relaxation and their pleasure in the indulgence of
their merely animal appetites, and forced, through
the want of proper education at the outset, and
fit means of obtaining or extending it afterwards,
to spend their evenings in ale-houses, and rest their
distinctions of honour and superiority on brawls
and fights. In Scotland generally, and in the
Athens in particular, it is very different. Almost
the whole of the working classes there have got
such an education in their youth as not only would
qualify them for ultimately being masters in their
respective trades, but which gives them an insatiable
thirst, not for technical knowledge in their
own professions merely, but for knowledge in general.
If one were to follow them home, after the
hours of their labour are over, one would not find
them besotting themselves with beer, and discussing
the circumstances of a prize-fight, in clouds of
smoke over a dirty newspaper, which the reader
has to spell as he gets on. No doubt they have
their carousals, and when they do drink, they drink
deeply; but it is not so much for the love of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
dissipation, as for some public or brotherly measure
which brings them together. You find one man
laying aside his apron to consult Adam Smith, dispute
with Malthus, or re-judge the judges of the
Edinburgh Review; another will be found solving
mathematical problems, or constructing architectural
plans; and all the less proficient will be found
attending evening classes, at which they are instructed
by able teachers, and for reasonable fees.</p>

<p>Society is indeed, as it were, reversed in the
Athens; the men of the law give their evenings to
Bacchus; those who are called philosophers, give
theirs to butterflies; the ladies associate for the
purposes of gossipping; and the gentlemen, with
praise-worthy gallantry, assist the ladies; while
the artizans pursue literature, and study philosophy.
Thus, although there be more both of the
one and the other in the Athens, than one would at
first sight suppose, the supposition is excusable
because they are not to be found where one would
first and most naturally seek for them.</p>

<p>But if these habits make the labouring classes in
the Athens more intelligent and delightful as a
people than the same classes are in England, they
render them as much more dangerous as a mob. It
is true, that any demagogue cannot lead them to
any mischief for any cause that he pleases, as is but
too often the case with a less informed and reflective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
population. But if they are not to be collected
or set on by every casual breath, it is not
every casual breath that will make them disperse,
or make them desist from their purpose. They
have repeatedly&mdash;indeed upon every occasion where
they have been aroused and brought together,
evinced an union and organization which, with
arms and perseverance, would have made them formidable
to a large military force; and they have kept
their plans so secret, and executed their purposes
with so much promptitude and skill, that the whole
of the legal and local authorities, in the joint exercise
of their wisdom and their fears, have not been
enabled to penetrate the one or prevent the other.
“The Porteus” mob is universally known; and a
gentleman who was an eye-witness gave me such an
account of a minor one, both in its object and in its
mischief, that occurred upon the result of the late
Queen Caroline’s trial, as convinced me that their
skill and their spirit have not yet abated.</p>

<p>The populace of the Athens, as well as of most
other places, resolved upon having a general illumination,
when the result of that trial was made known.
I do not say this was right, neither do I say that it
was wrong; but it was the will and the wish of the
people, and they did it. The official part of the
Athenians were of course against the measure, on
political grounds; and a very large proportion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the superior classes disliked it, either because they
had doubts of its propriety, or because they disliked
the expense and trouble. Disturbances were
apprehended, and the authorities took what they
were pleased to call “vigorous measures:” they gave
plenary power to Archy Campbell,&mdash;armed deacon
Knox with a great bludgeon,&mdash;supported the constabulary
with staves,&mdash;hung bayonets and cartouch-boxes
across the shoulders of the writers
clerks,&mdash;stuck swords behind the sheriff and advocates-depute,&mdash;sent
for the Lothian farmers and
their cart-horses,&mdash;collected the military detachments,&mdash;shotted
the guns of the Castle, and lighted
the linstocks,&mdash;dined, and put in the internal
armour of divers bottles of wine a-stomach,&mdash;and
then bolting as many doors upon themselves as ever
they could, sat down to wonder and wait for the
issue. After preparations so extensive in their
nature, and so profound in their organization, one
would naturally have supposed that not so much as
a rebellious candle would have been lighted, or an
Athenian lamp broken. But this was by no means
the case.</p>

<p>My informant, who had just arrived from Glasgow,
where a similar scene had been performed on
the preceding evening, with much credit to the
military, some little to the magistrates, and no
positive disgrace to the people, was induced, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the unusual radiance that he observed in the street,
to walk out and see what was the matter, or rather
how the matter was. He passed along Princes
Street, which exhibited nearly the same number of
candles, and the same taste in transparent paintings
that are usual upon other grease-burning and
gauze-daubing occasions; but the street itself was
unusually quiet, and free of people. As he stood
gazing at a window opposite the earthen mound,
in the decoration of which some painter had been
peculiarly happy in absurdity, a stranger took him
by the arm, and requested him to go to the other
side of the street, as where he stood he was by no
means safe. He hesitated, alleging that he heard
nothing. “But it is coming,” said the stranger,
“and the more silent it is the less safe.” They
crossed the street together; and my informant
looking towards the other end of the mound, observed
that the lamps were extinguished one by
one, and though not a tongue was heard, there
was a heavy and hurried tread as of a dense crowd
rapidly approaching. It came, filling the whole
breadth, and about half the length of the mound.
In the front were borne two transparencies, rendered
barely visible by dull blue lights behind. On
each flank were treble lines of men, armed with
stakes, which they had torn from a paling; and
the whole square, of which they formed two sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
was as thick in its composition and as regular and
rapid in its march as the Macedonian phalanx.
This thick phalanx moved along some of the principal
streets: when a voice in one key called out
one set of numbers, a shower of missiles instantly
demolished every pane in the windows; and when
a voice in another key called out another set of
numbers, not a stone was thrown. This mass of
people passed along the streets, and performed its
quantity of mischief with the silence and rapidity
of a destroying angel; and when it had wreaked
a double portion of violence upon the dwelling of
the Lord Provost, it melted away nobody knew
how, where, or by what agency. Meanwhile, the
alarm had been given to the powers and protectors;
but when they came to read the riot act, and
scatter the spoilers, there remained none to hear,
but shattered houses and frightened inmates, and
nothing to scatter, except fragments of glass.
Fortunately, the mischief was not very great; but
the manner in which it was done was enough to
show the superior tactics, and consequently superior
danger of an Athenian mob.</p>

<p>It is not, however, the education of politicians,
of professional men, or of the populace, which constitutes
that peculiar course of discipline which
deserves to be designated, as “the education of the
Athens.” That education is a training of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
manners more than of the mind,&mdash;an initiation into
the practices of life, rather than the principles of
any art, or of any science. Most species of education
imply some sort of restraint; but the Athenian
education is chiefly taken up with removing
the restraints that have been imposed in other
places, and by other systems; and the rapidity
with which students make proficiency in it is
without parallel in any of the ordinary schools or
colleges. A mere boy shall come from the remotest
glen or island of Scotland, as timid as a
hare, as modest as a maiden, and as honest as a
man of five feet in a mill-stone quarry; and yet,
astonishing to tell! three little months, sometimes
three little weeks, of Athenian tuition, shall make
him a perfect adept in all the theory, and an expert
proficient in all the practice of the Athenian
mysteries. No where else, indeed, can young men
be thus educated at so early an age; and it is the
boast of the Athens, that she frees the youth of
Scotland of more of their antiquated notions and
narrow prejudices than they could get rid of even
in London itself. The number of young men who
resort annually to the Athens as students in the
college, and under the private lecturers in the different
departments of medical science&mdash;who, as I
have said, are now in a great measure eclipsing and
supplanting the college professors, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the still greater number who throng to the offices
of the men of law, form a separate and unguardianed
and unguarded society of youths, greater
in proportion to the whole population than is to be
found in any other British city. They meet with
those of but a year’s longer standing, and these
meet those of but another year, and so on, till the
total take in every lesson-abhorring student, and
every quill-driving clerk, to the amount of some
thousands,&mdash;all of them furnished with at least
moderate means of supporting themselves, and
without the slightest check or control as to how
those means shall be expended. The studies of
the law-clerks are of an exceedingly dry description,
and those of the other students are not very
different. The infant scribes are set loose at an
early hour in the evening, and as the professors in
the Athens are said to be far more strict in looking
after their own fees than after the attendance of
the students, the whole of this mass of young persons
are left to govern themselves and each other
for nearly the half of every day in the week, and
almost the whole of Saturday and Sunday. Athenian
apprentices to the law are seldom lodged in
the families of their masters; and it is a rare thing
indeed for an Athenian student to be boarded with
his professor. Hence, both classes are allowed to
help each other in the formation of their habits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
without any control from the more experienced
part of society. It is the interest of the lodging-house-keepers,
with whom the greater part of them
reside, that their juvenile frolics should not come
to the ears of their relations; and therefore each is
allowed to indulge himself as he pleases, and the
only measure of indulgence is the purse.</p>

<p>While this mode of life holds out facilities for
indiscretions which the greater activity and occupation
of even a mercantile city prevent, the great
numbers take off the shame of individual transactions,
and give a fashion and eclât to what would
no where else be tolerated. Youths of no great
advance in life have their nightly drinking-bouts,
and boys, in the first year of their studies or apprenticeships,
have their occasional carousals in ale-houses
suited to the state of their funds. As the
greater number of young men in the Athens,
setting aside the working classes, whose conduct is
very different, are of this description, perhaps
they stamp upon the whole place much of its character;
and, especially in the several professions
connected with the law, they in all probability
stamp the greater part of it.</p>

<p>The results are just what might be expected.
There is no place that I visited where both the
manners and the morals of young persons are so
free; and, with a greater partiality for the bottle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and a greater proneness to all its consequences,
there is perhaps less moral feeling, and a less clear
perception either of intellectual or of moral truth,
among young men who have passed through the
several stages of an Athenian education, than
among those who have had their novitiate any
where else. Too young for reflection, and too
much exposed to temptation for study, their minds
become as desultory as their manners are dissipated;
and while yet they hardly know any thing,
they are prompt in their decision of every thing;
and having once found that it is easier, and gives
more notoriety to decide without thinking, than to
think without deciding, they become as dogmatical
in speech as they are shallow in knowledge,
and raw in experience.</p>

<p>The force of ardent and inexperienced passions,
just set loose from paternal restraint, the force of
every day’s example, the force of ridicule, and frequently
also the force of direct compulsion, all conspire
to drive every young man who goes to reside
in the Athens into these courses, and to keep him
in them as long as he continues to reside in the
Athens; and be it for study or for business, the
novitiate is in ordinary cases sufficiently long to
stamp the character for life. Accordingly it has
been remarked, that though young men who profited
by a regular course of Athenian study, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
often very showy and frequently very jovial as companions,
they are not very pre-eminent for sagacity
as counsellors, or trust-worthiness as friends. Coming
from the provinces in all their greenness, without
any principle, save that prudence which their parents
tried to inculcate, and getting rid of that very
speedily, they are left like blank-paper, upon which
the Athens may inscribe her peculiar characters.
There they grow up, and acquire the passions, and
learn the vices of men, while they have the intellect
only of boys.</p>

<p>Every part of the system tends to debauch their
morals, and deaden their intellectual perceptions,
and there are some parts of it that tend strongly to
make them as impertinent as they are ill-informed.
With many of them, and more especially with those
connected with the law, public speaking, or rather
public wrangling, such as they daily hear before
their Lordships, is regarded as the foremost and best
of all qualifications. Accordingly, they not only
have little disputing societies, at which the most
profound and grave questions are discussed and decided
in the least grave and profound manner, but
they also, not sometimes, but very frequently, carry
the same practices into their carousing parties,
whether in their own lodgings or at their respective
ale-houses. Thus they learn to make speeches,
which, like inflated bladders, are of a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
size, and smooth withal on the surface, but have
neither solidity nor weight. Of those who are thus
educated, a considerable portion are scattered over
the country, and perhaps in this way the Athens
draws both upon the virtue and the intelligence of
the age, in full for all that she gives in the way of
other education. Perhaps, indeed, setting aside the
political taints which have been noted as emanating
from the Athens, it were just as well for Scotland,
and not a bit worse for England, that Athenian
education of all kinds were confined between the
Loch of Duddingstone and the Water of Leith.
Of those again who are thus educated, and who
remain in the Athens, it may perhaps be said that
they turn round and inflict upon those who come
after, full retribution for what those who went before
inflicted upon themselves; and that with all her
boasted elegance and taste, there is perhaps no city
in which vice is more generally or more obtrusively
practised, than in this self-boasted model of taste
and purity.</p>

<p>The effects of this system of education may be
traced in the manners, and especially in the conversation,
of the Athenians, even when they have, as
one would suppose, risen above the standard and
outlived the vices of those juvenile associations.
The jokes which are quoted as being the indigenous
crop of the Parliament-House habitually, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of the bench occasionally, have almost uniformly a
latitude in them, which would not be tolerated in
similar places elsewhere; and perhaps one of the
most offensive collections that could be raked together,
would be a list of all the good things with
which the Athenians embellish their conversations,
as having been said and done by the men of whom
they boast; but as such a collection would be relished
no where except in the Athens, and with
Athenian disciples, it may, with great propriety, be
left as a chosen preserve, in which her own literati
may poach, when otherwise their stores become
exhausted, as must occasionally be the case even
with them.</p>

<p>A system of male education, such as I have attempted
to describe, must of course require a peculiar
system for females; but as female education is
every where much more matter of fact than of philosophy,
it would be improper to go into any investigation
or argument about it. In speaking of
such a subject, I might err: by remaining silent, I
cannot.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Before</span> you can at all characterize the manners of
the Athenians, you must have known them long
and intimately, and even then it is difficult to be
correct. In most things they are so extremely
changeful, if not contradictory, that in half the
time you would take to describe them in one aspect,
they pass into another; and they do so without
any cause which you can discover. At one
time you would think them all openness and
heart, but in a moment they start away, and look
exceedingly cold, stiff, and repulsive. They are
a hospitable people, certainly, or rather perhaps it
is more correct to say that they are entertainment-giving
people; but even in the most ostentatious
and prolonged of their hospitalities, you always
have the impression that they are acting a part&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
there is more show than substance in their
courtesies. You feel that you are received with
more parade than welcome; and if the sederunt be
continued, you find that there is more hilarity than
heart. They give you your dinner, and they shun
neither the quantity nor the praise of their liquor,
but they are not so much disposed to give you your
share of the conversation, of which themselves and
their city form, not the unvarying, but the inexhaustible
subject; and, taking for granted that, in
consequence of its primary importance and celebrity,
you, if you know any thing, cannot fail to be acquainted
with it even to the minutest particular,
they rattle away without ever giving you the least
preparation, and if you shew, or even hint ignorance
of the shufflings of their politics, the cases
before their courts, or the tattle of their coteries, the
utmost contempt is expressed at you, and the most
summary vengeance taken for your daring to be
ignorant of that which alone is worth knowing.</p>

<p>From the peculiar kind and manner of education
which I have noticed, the young men of the
Athens are more impertinent and self-sufficient than
those of any other place that I have seen. They
know not much, and the little that they do know is
far from being accurate; but they state their opinions
with a forwardness, and support even their
ignorance and their errors with a pertinacity at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
which you are quite astonished. Perhaps it is this
precocity in assertion which renders the Athenians
so querulous and dogmatical after they grow up.</p>

<p>As the sums of money which can be afforded to
be spent or squandered away in the Athens are not
great, there is not much deep playing or costly dissipation
in the city. But though the immorality of
the Athens costs less than that of a wealthier place,
there is not proportionally the less of it upon this
account; and though the number of what may be
termed gentleman-like indiscretions be very limited,
yet there is perhaps no place of equal proportion
which rivals the Athens in low vice. Indeed, the
vices of her people are almost all equally low, or if
there be any who strive to outdo their fellows, it is
by a deeper plunge in downright beastliness.</p>

<p>Among the dashing bloods of the Athens, the
squalor of a house is no objection whatever. Scotch
economy prompts them to get everything cheap, and
hence there are in the Athens sinks of vice, supported
and frequented by those who call themselves
gentlemen, that would hardly be tolerated, or even
supposed, in the very lowest neighbourhood of any
other place. I have been told that nothing can be
more shocking either to morality or taste, than the
midnight orgies of certain clubs of the Athenian
<i>esprits forts</i>; and among all ranks of the Athenians&mdash;I
mean among all the ranks of those who wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the dress and assume the name of gentlemen,&mdash;the
practice of drinking is both habitual and deep.</p>

<p>The real state of taste and civilization in any
place is perhaps better known from the vices of the
inhabitants, than from their virtues; and if the
Athens is to be judged by this standard, she has
not much of which she can boast, as the broad and
vulgar debaucheries of her people, not only occupy
much more of their time, but engross much more
of their conversation, than is the case in the British
metropolis. There is a cause for every thing, and
perhaps a reasonable part of the cause of this may
be found in that peculiarity of the Athenian education
which I noticed in a former chapter. The
purity, the ignorance, and the simplicity of the
number of young men and boys who are annually
added to the mass of the Athens, the novelty of
their having all restraint taken off, and the example
and encouragement with which they naturally meet,
dispose them to proceed to greater lengths in dissipation
than if their introduction were more gradual.
The limited nature of their finances, too, and the
operation of those lessons of thrift and parsimony,
which no parents are fonder of inculcating than the
Scotch, lead them to cheapness rather than elegance
in their pleasures; and the debased and vulgar
taste which they thus acquire in their boyhood,
clings to them after they are men, and not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
gives the tone to their vices, but in some measure
also to their whole character. Accordingly, in no
place that I have visited is there more license of
conversation, more general freedom from all manner
of restraint, and a more total absence of scruples
of any kind, than among the scribes of the Athens.
Still, to a certain extent, they are pleasant companions;
but they are so only to a certain extent. In
times not very remote, each of the pleaders before
the Supreme Courts in the Athens had his “whiskey-shop,”
in which he met with clients and solicitors,
received fees, and fortified himself in the spirit,
for appearing before the “fifteen.” Nor were
these grave personages themselves prone to forget
the lessons which they had learned during their noviciate
as students or clerks, and their probation as
members of the Faculty of Advocates. Whatever
was or is the talents or the connexions of those persons,
they were, and among the specimens that remain
still are, democrats in their drink. It seems
to be an Athenian maxim, that the bottle raises or
lowers all people to the same level; and the Athenians
still tell with a sort of pride, that when a celebrated
Judge, who flourished in the latter half of the
eighteenth century, had been missing for three days,
and was wanted to aid in the decision of a very important
cause, he was at length found upon the top
of the steeple of St. Giles’, where he had been carousing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and playing at cards with two or three members
of that illustrious and accommodating fraternity,
the <i>Caddies</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing strikes a stranger more than the difference
between the business streets and business
men of the Athens, and the corresponding streets
and men of London, or even of Glasgow. In
Bond Street, Oxford Street, or Ludgate Hill, all
is bustle and activity,&mdash;you cannot stand still,
though you would; and within the shop, every
one is completely occupied. The Athenian streets,
more especially the High Street, present quite
another spectacle. At every few yards you find
upon the pavement a knot of idlers, concealing
their hands in the pockets of their inexpressibles,
and alternately settling the affairs of the world,
(that is, of the Athens,) and criticising any stranger
that passes. Every shop-door too is a sort of rostrum
from which the occasional vender of brimstone
or blue bonnets, is often found vending
Athenian politics to customers of another description;
while, almost during the whole morning,
bevies of slip-shod damsels stand giggling together
at the entrances of the closes, in which innumerable
mops and slop-pails are exposed, but not for
sale.</p>

<p>Ever since the days of Allan Ramsay, an Athenian
bookseller has been a sort of oracle; and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the tribe have increased, their oracular powers
have become rich and varied. Constable, to whom,
by the way, the literary world is as much indebted
as to any man living, and who is a remarkable
instance of success against the whole current of
Athenian prejudice and opposition, has indeed too
much sense, as well as too much business, for
lounging and lecturing in a public shop; but even
Constable is obliged occasionally to submit to the
contact of that chaos of philosophic fragments,
which, like the atoms of Epicurus, reel and wrangle
on the benches by his counter. Blackwood too
has a sort of den; but still, when there is nobody
in it to gossip, you find his hard face poking out
at his shop-door, just as the tongue of a church-bell
pokes out at the mouth of that instrument of
noise and brass. Manners and Miller&mdash;one who is
said to be the only genuine species of the nightingale
north of the Tweed, keeps a saloon for the
accommodation of the Edinburgh blue stockings,
in which sins, and sentiments, and silks, are, by
turns, expatiated upon, in a style and manner
which are truly Athenian. Not far from the
Tron Kirk, there is perhaps the most wonderful
of them all,&mdash;the Œdipus of all mysteries and
riddles, as touching law, and learning, and politics&mdash;to
the junior clerks who attend the parliament-house;
the fag end of the Athenian company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of comedians, and of the satellites of opposition in
Athenian politics. Œdipus believes that the whole
world rests upon his shoulders; and, whether he be
haranguing from behind his counter, or trotting
along the street, he is constantly hitching up his
shoulders as if he were alarmed lest that world
should go off its poise. But to see this little man
in the zenith of his glory, you must see him in the
parliament-house, where he is regularly found, as
soon as the clerks have gone to the desk, and the
players to the rehearsal, running about with so
much eagerness and appearance of wisdom, that,
until he speaks, you would mistake him for
Jeffery, or rather for Henry Cockburn, to whom
he has one similitude&mdash;that of a naked poll. As
he has previously argued or decided every cause
that can come before any of the courts, he comes,
not to profit by the wisdom of the more express
organs of the law, but to tell how far they deflect
from the right, by swerving from his institutes.</p>

<p>Each bookseller has, not only his levee as well-attended
as ever that of Sir Richard Phillips in
his glory was by ten-shilling-a-sheet overpaid authors,
but his evening party, in which he shines.
Thus Constable dines with deep-going politicians,
Blackwood frequents prayer-meetings, Manners
and Miller whistle,&mdash;this one associates with fiddlers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and that takes the unprotected females under the
folds of his calf-skin mantle.</p>

<p>But, although each of the notable Athenians has
his peculiar place and way of holding forth, there
is a regular intercourse among them all; and accounts
current of praise or censure are as regular
and frequent among the Athenians, as those of
cash are among other people. Indeed, if it were
not for this curious banking system, it is very
doubtful whether the intellectual “patrimony or
conquest” of any one Athenian would be sufficient
to set him up in business as a regular and everyday
subject of conversation. Thus, whenever you
find an Athenian cutting his first figure, no matter
what sort of figure it is, in one part of the city,
you are sure to hear somebody making a great
deal of noise either for or against that figure in
another part.</p>

<p>But manners are, however, somewhat like the
mind itself,&mdash;we can observe their phenomena, and
trace their effects; but, as they are in themselves
nothing more than the various states of an ever-changing
something which we can never exactly
comprehend, no abstract disquisition upon them,
even as they are found in the Athens, would bear
to be read, although one should be at the trouble
of writing it. When we grapple with them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
real flesh and blood, and can say that this is
Archy Campbell, or this his Majesty’s Advocate,&mdash;that
this is Mrs. Macspine, who studies the Differential
Calculus,&mdash;or that Lady Macfidget, who
calculates differences, or makes them for other
people’s calculation,&mdash;then the gentle readers draw
their chairs together, and prepare for that most
delectable of all entertainments,&mdash;the dissection of
an individual character; but when we treat of the
disembodied virtues or vices, we are allowed the
sole and exclusive benefit of our lucubrations.</p>

<p>Still, it is impossible to overlook the rapidity
with which all sorts of things whisk about in the
Athens, and how cleverly her ladies and gentlemen
creep into the nut-shells of science, or the whispering-corners
of scandal; or how dextrously they
contrive to make one thing answer many purposes.
It is impossible that any people, and more especially
a people so ardent and so educated as the
Athenians, can be without a reasonable commodity
of love; but the talking apparatus is so sensitive
to the slightest touch, and vibrates so instantaneously
over the whole city, that this commodity
cannot be brought into action in the ordinary way.
Accordingly, the various systems of philosophy
which have from time to time warmed and gladdened
the Athenians, have been, in a great measure,
a succession of bows and quivers for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
artillery of Cupid. Sometimes they were awkward
enough for this purpose; and the barbs and feathers
of those instruments of man’s mischief, sticking
out at the ends of arguments against revelation,
or disquisitions upon cause and effect, had rather
a ludicrous appearance. When Smellie brought
the philosophy of beasts into vogue, matters
mended a little; and youths and virgins sauntered
away into the fields for the pure and intellectual
purposes of investigating the origin and
progress of lambs and linnets. The day of the
botanists was equally favourable for erotic purposes;
and when the researches of Doctor Hutton
had made the fairy-rings upon Arthur’s Seat matter
of philosophy, thither winded the philosophic
fair of the Athens, under the soft beams of the
chaste moon, just to see whether they could catch
a glimpse of the green elves, capering and dancing
to the tune of “Catherine Ogie,” as Scotch fairies
had been known to do from time immemorial.</p>

<p>But the best system that ever came into general
practice and belief, has proved to be that of the
skull-men,&mdash;a system which, though the Athenians
gainsayed it a little at the outset, they have subsequently
fallen deeper into than any other people
upon the earth or moon; and in a truly-bred
Athenian company, you are sure to have your
cranium thumbed over by every lady and gentleman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
This is an excellent system, if there be
truth in it; and indeed, whether there be truth in it
or not, it brings the papillæ of the fingers, whose
very use is the receiving of impressions, into contact
as it were with the very elements of the soul;
and when the delicate fingers of a lady are measuring
the base and altitude of No. 1. in a gentleman’s
neck, there is every chance that the embers
of the tender passion, if they have not previously
been charred to incineration, shall blaze or burn.</p>

<p>Nor is this the only use to which the Athenians
apply this philosophy. They are so quick in their
perception, that they instantly know the strong and
the weak points of your character, and they regulate
their proceedings accordingly. If, for instance,
your indications of combativeness be strongly developed,
they are sure never to offer the least
insult; but if you be wanting in those indications,
they make you feel it. If your forehead shows
wit, they are exceedingly humdrum and metaphysical;
but if the contrary, they treat you with
quips and puns without end. Knowing from the
peculiar structure and exercise of their own admiration,
that people admire the most that in which
they excel the least, they make sure of shining by
turning the conversation to those subjects of which,
judging from your organization, you have the
least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The religion of the Athenians is, perhaps, one
of their greatest peculiarities: they,&mdash;meaning the
people of consideration, and not the populace,&mdash;are
the most religiously irreligious people that one
can imagine. A few years ago, when it was the
fashion to be sceptical, the very name of going to
church stamped a man as belonging to the veriest
vulgar; but the kirk has again come into vogue,
and it is now just as much a mark of vulgarity not
to go there, as it then was to go. If, however, the
value of their church-going were to be tried by
their conduct during the week, its moral advantages
would not be found great. But it answers many
purposes: the official men find their interest in
being kirk-elders; ladies and gentlemen see each
other; and after so pious and praise-worthy a
thing as church-going, there can be little harm in
an assignation, or an adjournment to a tavern-dinner,&mdash;occurrences
which are very frequent upon
the evenings of Athenian Sundays. When you
have witnessed the deep and prolonged potations
of some Athenian worthy upon the Saturday night,
when you have heard the racy jokes and anecdotes
with which he enlivened his cups, and when you
have marked how small store he set by the principles
as well as the practices of religion, you wonder
at the calm face that he puts on as he stands at the
church-door, watching the pence and sixpences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
that are thrown into the charity-plate. It is all a
cloak, however, and like other cloaks, the more
cumbrous that it is, it is the sooner cast off. One
cause of its being put on at all, may be, that the
fashion of the higher classes going to church carries
the lower classes there also; and nobody can
pass the receiving hoard, which is watched by a
provost or a judge, without contributing something
to the increase of voluntary charity; which being thus
obtained from the poor, prevents the necessity of
levying so large contributions on the rich. I have
stated this reason, not only because it is both pleasurable
and profitable, but because, whatever it
may be in its primary intention, in its ultimate
result it is good. Every thing which tends to
place the labouring classes, if but for a moment, or
during the performance of a single act, upon the
same level with those who do not labour, is highly
advantageous to them; and thus, admitting that
the Athenians go to church as well to save their
pockets as to compound for the doings of the week,
the said Athenians do, upon that account, deserve
nothing but praise.</p>

<p>Leaving the church-going, and subsequent feasting
and flirtation out of the question, there is
something peculiar in an Athenian Sabbath: it
seems as though useful labour and innocent amusements
were the only things that deserve to be suspended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
The advocates are a privileged class, and
it is no scandal in them to drudge at their cases.
As little is there any harm whatever in oral discussion
of any subject imaginable; but if a maid-servant
were to hum a tune, an advocate’s wife to give a
thump to the piano-forte, or a boarding-school miss to
peep into a new novel, the Athens would be in the
utmost jeopardy of sinking in the Forth, in which
the sinner would have some chance of being ducked.
It must not, however, be supposed that among
such a people as the Athenians, the Sunday is a
day of idleness. It is no such thing; for with
both men and women, it is the choice and chosen
day of the week, set apart to all manner of gossip
and enjoyment; and though it be not the fashion
for the people to listen to the music of instruments,
or read profane books, yet the music of woman’s
tongue is soft and sweet, and the book of fate is
opened. Whether the present church-going propensity
of the Athens shall continue, is a question
that it would be difficult to solve; but that the
Athens will continue to enjoy herself upon Sunday
nights, may be received into the catalogue of
truths that are demonstrated.</p>

<hr class="d6" />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> wonderful agility with which the Athenians
skip about from opinion to opinion in other matters,
and the great faculty which they show in altering
the attitude and aspect of that everlasting subject,
their own city, render it next to impossible to
give a likeness of them that shall be accurate for
one moment beyond the time that you are taking
it. Indeed, if you be not all the readier at your
pencil, the chance is that there shall be no congruity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
or keeping among the features and limbs
that you sketch. What you begin with as a
Jupiter, you have a chance of ending with as a
Vulcan; your Apollo glides into a satyr, and your
Venus becomes a hag under your hands. If you
would paint a philosopher, however limber or
however large you design him, he changes to a
driveller or a dandy before you know what you are
about; and when you follow him to his home, in
order to contemplate the progress of those great
things with which he is to enlighten and astonish
the world, you find the whole of his mighty mind
occupied in fitting false shoulders to his waistcoat,
or dipping his whiskers in the essence of Tyne, till
the tale run down his cheeks in purple demonstration
as he flounders along in the ball-room.
Under such circumstances, I ought not to be
blamed, although the light in which I have attempted
to represent the Athenians be not that in
which they may have appeared to others; nor
ought they who fancy that their picture is more
accurate than mine, to allow themselves to fall into
that idolatrous worship of the Athenian gods; for
they may rest assured that there can be more than
two pictures of the Athens, all very unlike each
other, and yet all very like the original.</p>

<p>The <i>wit</i> of the Athenians may be considered as
one of their “fundamental features,” for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
reasons, and for this among the rest, that it mainly
consists of punning, which is accounted the lowest
stratum, and therefore the foundation of all wit
whatsoever. It is of various kinds and degrees,
according to the class of persons among whom it
passes current; but still the basis of every Athenian
witticism is a pun, and every Athenian, though he
should be nothing else, is sure to be a punster.
There are two original species of Athenian pun,&mdash;the
legal and the learned: the first is said to have
been introduced by the late Henry Erskine, and
the second is contested by the late Professor Hill,
Dr. Brewster, and others. Whether this be true
at all, and if true, how far the truth of it extends,
I am not either bound or prepared to say, but certain
it is that those learned and humorous persons
get more of it laid at their door than do any others
now in existence; and the “gentleman of the
Dunciad” who was “determined that every good
thing should be Shakspeare’s,” has many praise-worthy
imitators in the Gem of the North. You
cannot meet with an idle draper yawning at the
door of a shop, who has not some good thing of
Harry Erskine to tell you; nor is there a student
within the Athenian college who has not John Hill
by rote. Brewster, indeed, is not so often quoted;
but Brewster is still alive, and what is more, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
holds no public function or situation of any great
consequence.</p>

<p>I went to view the Advocates’ Library, in company
with two of that faculty; and they edified
me with sundry choice sayings of the immortal
Harry. I remarked, that it was singular that the
advocates, the most illustrious body within the
Scotch seas, should have been the last to have a
hall in which to contain their collection of books.
“The same remark was made,” said my conductor,
“to the late Honourable Henry Erskine,
and he said a very clever thing upon the subject.”
I very naturally gave him that wishing and inquiring
look, which brings out a good thing without
any preamble; and he, after working a-while
at his ears, hemming, and rubbing his spectacles,
said, “Why, Sir, I must condescend, <i>in limine</i>,
that the Dean of Faculty, (Mr. Erskine was once
Dean, and the title continues longer than the
office,) was a great wit, and that ‘a mortification,’
according to our vocabulary, means a bequest
of money or property of any kind; and,
having given in this condescendence, I will proceed
to the argument of the case. Well, Sir, a
gentleman was remarking to the Dean, the shame
that it was to the faculty, that they had not a
better apartment for their library. ‘We shall get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
it some time, and get it in a Christian way,’ said
the Dean, with that happy look which always
indicated that there was something to come. ‘Why
in a Christian way?’ said the gentleman. ‘Because,’
said the Dean, ‘we shall get it through
the <i>mortification of our members</i>,’ at which the
gentleman laughed very heartily.” I, of course, had
no choice but to laugh also, although the wit ran a
little too slow for me; but my laugh was taken
with more cordiality than I had grace to give it
with, and that was a signal for more of the same
kind, of which I may mention a specimen or two.
A case was argued one day before Lord Braxfield,
in which the counsel had rather exposed a
position which that hasty judge had laid down a
few days previous; and his lordship was so much
irritated, that he snatched up a ruler, and brandished
it at the counsel, as much as to say, “if
I had you out of court, I would cudgel you.”
“What does he mean by that?” said an English
barrister who happened to be present. “He is
doing that which you must have done often,” said
Erskine, “he is <i>taking a rule to show cause</i>.”
“Why that is rather a novel rule to take in a
court of justice,” said the Englishman. “Not at
all,” replied Erskine, “it is merely a rule <i>nisi</i>.”
One of the latest of Erskine’s witticisms that were
repeated to me was that of the two Macnabs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
father and son,&mdash;the first of whom was chief of
that sept of the Celts, and the other the author of
a system of the universe, too sublime even for
Athenian comprehension. The chief was the most
patriarchal as well as the most powerful man of his
day, and the number of his sons and daughters
rivalled that of some of the illustrious patriarchs
of olden time. Harry Erskine said, that “these
two Macnabs were the two greatest men that ever
had lived, for the one could make a world, and
the other could people it.” Another saying of his
was very often repeated to me, but I confess I
never could see the point of it. A Tory lawyer,
of feeble body and feebler mind, was elevated to
the bench, and the Athenians supposed that a
Whig, remarkable alike for his talents and the
slowness of his motions, had been improperly overlooked,
while the little Tory was promoted. It
was remarked to Erskine, that they “had put
the cart before the horse.” “No,” said Harry,
“they have not done that, they have only put
the ass before the elephant.” Another time, when
a client was hesitating into which of the hands of
two writers to the signet he should throw himself,
somebody said, he was like the ass between
the two bundles of hay. “No,” said Erskine,
“he is like the bundle of hay between the two
asses; for, whichever way he goes, he will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
eaten up.” This species of pun is mostly confined
to Whigs, or gentlemen who have some
pretensions to literature or taste; and in as
far as intellectuality can be predicated of such
matters, it may be called the <i>pun intellectual</i>.
From Harry Erskine, the intellectual pun of
the Athenian barristers does not appear to have
descended full and entire to any one individual. A
small piece fell to the share of George Cranstoun;
but he is too independent for using it, and therefore
he is said to have laid it out at interest for the benefit
of the next generation. John Archibald Murray
got a slice, but it was from the side upon which
the article had lain for some time, and thus it is said
to be somewhat musty. Jeffrey got a choice cut,
but he is said to have carried it so long in his
breeches-pocket, among slips of the Review, that it
is as hard as granite. Cockburn got a large piece
out of the very middle, but he is reported as having
stuck it over so thickly with sugar-plums, that
the original owner would have great difficulty in
knowing it. The kissing-crust, and a dainty crust
it is, fell to the share of John Clerk, but John is
said to have soaked it so much in butter, that delicate
stomachs are unable to bear it. After such a
distribution, it seems exceedingly doubtful whether
the whole can be again reunited; and while one
laments the cutting up of the thing itself, one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
amused at the more slender Whiglings, who run
about showing, boasting, and smacking the waste-paper
in which it was originally wrapped up.</p>

<p>There is another species of legal pun, which
first came to maturity under M’Queen, of Braxfield.
This may be styled the pun <i>ad hominem</i>,
and is calculated to depress the spirits in the same
ratio as the other is calculated to raise them. While
I was in the Athens it was by no means common in
the Parliament-House, but I was told that it forms
a standard dish at all loyal and official feasts, and
that upon ordinary occasions it lies in Blackwood’s
shop for the inspection of the curious.</p>

<p>The learned pun is of several kinds, according
to the class by whom it is used. That which was
brought to perfection by Professor Hill was a sort
of polyglot. For instance, in order to indicate
learning, and wit, and tea, the Professor inscribed
his tea-chest with the word “<i>doces</i>,” and when upon
a cold winter day, one of his students kept bawling
“<i>claude ostium</i>;” so loud as to give annoyance,
the Professor turned upon him with “<i>claude os
tuum</i>,” which gained him more admiration with the
Athenians than if he had rivalled Porson himself.</p>

<p>None of those kinds of punning are, however, to
be regarded as purely Athenian. They were all
invented or improved by strangers; and if one
wishes to become acquainted with the genuine Athenian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
pun in all its simplicity, one must seek it at
those coteries of small philosophers and blue-stockings,
which are found at Athenian suppers, more
especially on Sunday evenings, for it is by much
too delicate and weakly a thing for lasting even till
the day following.</p>

<p>The whole sports and amusements that are peculiar
and congenial to the Athenians seem to be regulated
by a kind of Salique Law. They being
such as females can neither join in nor, in most instances,
witness. They are of two kinds: the
amusements of the tavern, and the amusements of
the turf. In the former, “high jinks,” and the
other harmless fooleries of the olden time, have
given place to the orgies of hell-fire clubs, and
others that are better undescribed; but in the latter,
“golf” and “curling” continue to divide the year,
and the wisdom of the Athens may be seen during
the summer exercising itself daily in urging the
ball upon Bruntsfield-Links, and during the winter
in hurling large stones along the ice upon the Loch
of Duddingstone. Although there be many good
places for walking in the vicinity of the Athens, no
such thing is known as a public promenade&mdash;that is
forbidden on Sunday, and, except a trot along
Princes Street, and a moon-light turn around the
Calton, the gentlemen of the Athens are too busy,
either in doing something, or in doing nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
for promenading during the week. Drive there is
none, and it is not much to be regretted, for there
is absolutely nothing to be driven.</p>

<p>Another small feature in the character of the
Athenians is the high and supercilious disdain with
which they affect to look down, not merely upon
their fellow-Scotchmen, but upon all the world.
How they originally came by this quality, it would
not be easy to determine, and therefore it is, perhaps,
needless to inquire; but, as it is permanent
and general, it must have something upon which
it permanently feeds. It is by no means peculiar
to those who are born in the Athens; for no
sooner does a Lowland clown take up his locality
there as a writer’s clerk, than he begins to toss up
his head at the land which produced and fed him,
and “writes himself <i>armigero</i>; in any bill, warrant,
quittance, or obligation, <i>armigero</i>.” And
no sooner does a tattered and trowserless <i>Rorie</i>
escape from the wilds of Sutherland, or the woods
of Rannoch, to lug half an Athenian fair one
from tea-party to tea-party, than “she is a shentlemans,
and teuks her whisky wi’ a ‘Cot tam’
like a loört;” and, in fact, it seems a contest between
those two sets of worthies, which shall take
the lead in Athenian dandyism. Indeed, in personal
grace at least, the “shentlemans” must be
allowed to have much the better of the “armigero.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>”
Light food and long journeys give to the former
great buoyancy of spirits, and elasticity of muscle;
and it is wonderful to notice, with what a dignified
and chieftain-like air, they thumb a pitch-black
pack of cards, or “teuk oot the linin’” of a
quart pot of small beer, or quartern of the dew
of the mountains, as they hold their morning levee
at a corner in Queen Street or Abercrombie Place.
The “armigero,” on the other hand, is as gawky-looking
an article as it is possible to meet with, or
even to conceive. His feet, which probably not
six weeks previous were dragging a stone weight
of shoes and mud, through the clay of Gowrie, or
the tough loam of Lothian or Fife, are squeezed
into a pair of boots, upon which they are taking
vengeance, by stretching the leg an inch and a
half over every side of the heel; his great red
hands, put you more in mind of lobsters than of
any thing human, and they are dangling from his
shoulders as if each articulation were strung with
wire; and when his deep and dismal Doric is drawled
out into what is reckoned the fashionable accent in
the Athens, you can liken it to nothing but a duet
composed of the love songs of Jack Ass and Tom
Cat. In consequence of the number of those two
classes of Athenian dandies, dandyism of a higher
order is banished. I mentioned formerly that there
is no such thing either as a drive or an article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
driven (quills always excepted,) anywhere about the
Athens; and therefore no fashionable gentlemen
could endure the association of the Athenian pavé.
If such men should by accident get there, he would
not be eclipsed, but he would be absolutely buried
under the thick mass of the turf of the mountains,
and the clods of the valleys.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is this total absence of every thing
elegant in the shape of man from the public streets
and walks of the Athens, that has given so singular
a twist to the minds and manners of the Athenian
fair. Those dandies, instead of being objects for
admiration, are subjects for criticism; and when an
Athenian belle first quits her bread and butter, and
flits forth to conquer the world&mdash;heedless of the
fact, that such was the condition of a dear papa
ere he <i>booed</i> himself into some government office,
“processed” (I do not use that word in the
Yankee meaning,) into the management of some
laird’s estate, or the estate itself&mdash;she curls up her
nose at these, the only “creatures” that she meets,
with so much force as to give it, as Dr. Barclay
would say, “a sidereal aspect” for life. For a
long time she holds fast her aversion; but though
her nose be elevated, her fortunes do not rise along
with it. Time drives the wheels of his curricle
across her countenance, and there is no filling up
the ruts which they leave. Meanwhile the despised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
clerks become wigged advocates, or wily
solicitors; and the lady stretches her neck over
her six-pair-of-stairs window, to catch a glance of
the bustling man of business whom she despised and
contemned when he was a Princes-street walking boy,
and would have accounted her society and countenance
the very choicest thing in the world. Time,
who is the most delightful of all visitors during the
early stage of his acquaintance, gradually introduces
his friends; and at last, old hobbling Despair is admitted
into his coterie. In some places, the ladies
to whom he has been introduced seek their quietus
at the card-table; in others, they abandon this
world for the next, and very frequently choose the
by-paths to heaven&mdash;because a way thronged with
dissenting ministers is always a sort of love-lane, in
which a lady may at least gather the dry stalks of
those flowers which she neglected to pull while
they were in season. But in the Athens they go
another way to work,&mdash;they dip their stockings in
heaven’s azure, pass through the hoops of small
philosophy to the heaven-ward attic, (from which,
perchance, the Athens takes its name,) and thence
launch the bolts of their criticism against all the
world below&mdash;that is, all the world of their own
sex, and below their own age.</p>

<p>Thus have I with, as an Athenian <i>Literatus</i>
would say, “the softest feather dipt in mildest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
ink” and with uniform watchfulness against unmerited
praise and undeserved censure, noted down
a few of those features and traits which stamp upon
the Modern Athens, the isolation and individuality
of her character, as she stands away from other
cities, and appears in herself. Had I followed her
own <i>modus operandi</i>,&mdash;had I torn in pieces the
private characters of all to whom I found it necessary
to advert for the purposes of illustration, and
sported with the mangled fragments in the open
streets,&mdash;had I dug into their family vaults, and
wantonly exposed the bones of their ancestors to
the gaze of every passer by,&mdash;and had I set the
signet of my approbation or disapprobation upon
them, not on account of what they were in themselves,
but of whence they sprung, what they
possessed, and how they were connected,&mdash;then,
assuredly, the spirit of my writing would have
been more in accordance with the Athenian spirit,
and I would have been loved, lauded, and adopted
as a worthy and hopeful son of the aspiring attic
of the <i>Græcia mendax</i>. But such honour is not
my ambition; and therefore my study has been to
describe things with all the simplicity of truth,
and, as in whatever bearing the semblance of censure
I have written, I have wished and attempted
to be corrective rather than caustic&mdash;to go to
the causes of evil rather than to play with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
symptoms of it, I must conclude, that if any
shall blame me for the freedom of my words, they
must do it because their hearts are smitten, and
not because their deeds are misrepresented. The
Athens boasts of herself as a model of elegance
and of taste: I found her a compound of squalour
and of vulgarity. She boasts of her philosophy:
I found it pursuing thistle-down over
the wilderness. She boasts of her literary spirit:
I found her literature a mere disjointed skeleton,
or rather the cast-skin of a toothless serpent.
She boasts of her public spirit: I found
almost every man pursuing his own petty interests,
by the most sinister and contemptible
means; and, perchance, the most noisy of her
patriots standing open-mouthed, if so that the
very smallest fragment of place or pension might
drop into them. She boasts of the encouragements
that she has given to genius: I looked
into the record, and I found that every man
of genius who had depended upon her patronage,
had been debauched and starved. She
boasts of the purity of her manners: I found the
one sex engaged in slander as a trade, and the
other in low sensuality as a profession. Under
those findings&mdash;and they required not to be sought&mdash;I
had no alternative for my judgment. When
she redeems herself from them, and becomes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
reality even something like what she would call
herself in name, let her then make comparisons with
the Gem of ancient Greece. Let her give some
proof that Minerva Parthenon is her tutelar goddess;
when she has done so, let her build the
temple to that divinity; and, as she finishes the
sculpture of the last metope, with deeds of her
own worthy of being recorded, I (as the Turk did
when her countrymen completed the spoliation of
the ancient Athena,) shall to the completion of
the merit which she claims, subscribe</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
